But now my shell is weightless and fireproof
All I had to do was lay my money down and pick it up
(we are our own enemy, we are our own)
Keep it just between you and me
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
Whats all this talk about truth and devotion?
Like a hand in a velvet glove
Now when I went to get her we went to dinner and ate right
I don't want to see you cry
And it brought me to you
hold on brother of mine.
They say money make a nigga act nigger-ish
To the brink of the unknown
footprints giving clue to where we are
Blow, click, click, pow, click pow
She had to be good-looking
Uh, where my dogs at? (what, uh)
Hasta que sale el sol.
And let the clocks do all the worrying for once
SHE SENT ME PICTURES MAN THIS GIRL'S SO BAD
'Cause I tried and tried
I need you to make the bitter taste so sweet-
It's the world I see who's suffering
That I just can't hide
And all the guns is in Kesha's name
Your love has such a grip on me it chokes me like a vine
Happiness too good to be, too good to be, too good to be, yeah, yeah
But I need You as You guide me through today
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
The shoes rims I call it football
And Sometimes Im uneasy, but its all good
It took all the strength I had
what would it take to get you closer
For a thing to explode
Don't drown in the mo dawn
Making paper wads from napkins throwing toothpicks on the floor
Give it to me one time now
Of music, 1995 was mad confusin'
Dancin' dirty while I'm flirtin', 'cause he checkin' up on me
I see what I was looking for, for so long
We can't win and we're stuck here together
And I didn't know I was lost
Girl at times when I thought it was done you would call and gone forever
She say she want a real nigga
so fuck the world fuck love fuck man and you
You know that we showed them all
When it comes to boning I'm representing
'Cause there ain't no doubt
For the movement that's in you
Esta cancin est bien hecho,
'Cause lately I've been stumbling, feels like I'm recovering
And I will stumble and fall
And I need to change, and I need to say
Dar Å£ie Å£i-e P. O. H. U. I.
Ya' know what I'm sayin'
I can be your hot girl
Understand my nigga, its all about crime
But we do the dishes
my life is kept within your hands
Solange man es nicht befiehlt.
Turn around, sit down, here it comes
And so I sit back in my seat
A glance from their eyes showing no future at all
I want someone to be just mine
If you keep on treating me the way you do
Seas would rise when I gave the word
They know what I'm after
It took so long, it's been hard to find
I get to do it all wrong (i get to do it all wrong)
All the liquor that I find myself drinkin so often
What is he thinking, he had gold in his hands
Now you can get with that
I came down from the top and I drink every drop
When I look in your eyes there's no stopin' me
We're more like a house than a home, oh
Why no vayas a parar
Gettin' money is what I do
I don't want to lose you, not before I change
And word to his Mother Hubbard, he could introduce
Uh-huh, a-ight, then let me guide you (to da beat!) into my world
Fa real yo, it's crazy yo', drama all day yo
I take a bow and leave
If love is against the law listen I don't know
Hearing voices from miles away
When they're ringing your curtain down
We are all transparent now, been on hold
I wanna be a Hare Krishna
'Til you mean what you say
Take all that fly jewelry, and give it to my moms
This is nothing new to me
Go on your lonesome, and I'll catch you there anyway
It's as if you know me better
I sing loud words that make me cry
Tell Your People That I Got Us And That's A Promise.
I won't disturb you anymore
You know I still fear the bomb
Ans we were smart kids with too much to say.
Who can give me love until I'm satisfied
I caught her cornering the pictures in her purse
Murder in the skies, black September morning.
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that bass
Just a helpless bystander waving your flag in mute acceptance?
Making the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
The fuck you screamin' on me for I'm puttin' in work
You are the sun that lights my world
A kiss is not just a kiss
When I said these things I believed in kings
Nobody knows the way that it is
My words is a flame thrower
Lieder wie diese rauszubringen - weil damit garantiert ist,
The greatest victory it was
Uh uh, uh uh, uh
dont see you but i feel you try to say goodbye
'Mam - shut your motherfucking mouth
Oh, i wish she can be the Bonnie to my Clyde.
Which one of us would be the fool?
You must leave this land forever more or
I still cling to the petticoats
the writing still shines through
You shouldn't ask what is he doing with that broom
Of all the tears that I've had to waste
Booty bouncy bounce b-booty bounce
Freight train coming [Repeat: x2]
You never should have left them alone
Looking for my ticket to a higher place
How long since she grew her hair to keep
Que haberlo dejado fue lo mejor
Baby let me drink from your well 'til your well runs dry
Aventador, Gold Daytons, its a Compton thing
'Cause that minus is too low to see, yeah
its 1 o'clock niggas are lock I catch shuma
system. And right about now we got Eazy E and MC Ren in the studio
someday we'll be together, tell everybody now
It's half awkward, yet half grace.
A cyber world based on data files
And the Lost and the Damned cut you off with the bikes
But now it shouldn't have to be this way
Or I'm gonna steal it away, tonight
(Cocaine) I got to get my money, you think shit is funny
I'll do my best to make things right
And teach you somethin' homie, before them killers snatch you
Fear sees a ceiling, hope sees the stars
Somebody else must invest in manufacturing all those dirty fucking stinking bombs
R.I.P. to my baby bro, UGK until
Cowboys playing, young men slaying
If you can leave me for an hour, have money and power,
I said, bless my eyes today as I would say
La vie ne m'apprend rien
But if there's anything out there
If its the last thing we ever do
NaÃ§Ã£o sem teto, Angola, Ketu, Congo, Soweto
In my ashtray, there's always a roach
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy
We're calling on fire, God
If only he stood out from the crowd
I know you'll like it, so come over here, she says
Here's a song for you I play
I guess they're throwing their drawers
When I did the Vibe cover, holdin my crotch
E quante volte nel profondo tornerai
Maximum can u risk? can u?
Only you could stop the bleeding, give me what I'm needing
Don't shake it too hard or you'll bust them breeches
Kiss my lips for the last time and then darling
This is not the end of the world
Hey, yeah (bad boys, bad boys)
I'll leave when I wanna
Peeping through the curtains in my dog costume
Chances are good you're gonna wake up dead"
Do with me what you please
You're my flowers and sunshine cherries and red wine
coz you've done all the games
Drunk in their hollow town
Money cash hoes, money cash chicks what?
But let me feel you
I let you see my dark side
Go Karli go, kauf uns ein Haus mit Bad und Klo
So I'll be killing time in the blue shadows
Heute heisst es ich und du
You're gonna be a big man someday
You dont have a reason for the feelings you got
If you got a straight line
You could speak well of me
The trouble with white people
One more chance to keep on lovin' you yeah one more chance to keep on lovin' you
que dificil es pedir perdon,
continua sacudiendo. La neta si que
Show me that you really want it
And it echoes through the land
see you face to face
But you gently keep me
Then you'd still be a part of me
You are far, far away from me only in my mind
Do you want to believe
I'll take your lies and crush them in my hands
I always want to swallow you down
Putting yellow journalists under pressure to keep quiet
I heard it through the grapevine
In the summer that I was baptized
You can't break the law with them
I would like to get to know you
All the years that have come to pass
I'll wait for you there
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger
Baby, it ain't gonna suck itself
Your message so clearly defined
Napoleon murphy brock (tenor saxophone, flute, lead vocals)
Make your vocal chords reach the clouds and
Makin all kinds of enemies
I can see for miles
I'm just a sign, it's all gone wrong
In the club we be V.I.P. you tryin' to be like me
No puedo aguantar este grito
cause my dreams and them just wouldn't flow
Now that I can't make it without you
Than to all those men
Until it was much too late to recover
And I can't drive so steady, and already
Oh yer, oh yer, what a wonderful life
If we all left it alone
I ay que pasteles deliciosos como tu mi amiga
We do the pata pata we just rock it steady
Now we're facing the flood and it's rising fast
Nowadays Flipmode money be runnin mad North
Hear from the streets like 'where my doggs at?'
Just like that, I don't care
And I don't need the practice
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right,
walking down the street four men carrying bags of cash ran me down
hiding from the truth too long
In the shower under fire
esta vez el esclavo se escapÃ³
It's a one a way street in a one horse town
Nunca nadie me podrÃ¡ parar
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
All my friends, they put me down
Cruisin' through the garden district I was out of mind
im not being difficult i just need to know the truth
Now that I living my life for You
Studios get blown from D&D; to Mystic
The stars in the sky illuminate below,
And I've come very close to fallin' in love
Claimin that your mail is tall
I just murdered Micheal Myers
Gazed upon with dead lovers eyes
your best to throw you hands high
Ã une seule femme j'dis "I love you"
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Dogs on leads, dogs on leads
The struggle and suffering that won't go away
Hat to the back, make my way to the bar
Monkey ass niggas talkin all crazy
I let off first then I let off again
If I ruled the world
In the mansions bright and blessed
Makaveli the don, Killa Kadafi
So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow
Curse the mind that mounts the clouds
Nuh Devil worship a caan come inna we heart
You could be the one
Que todo por ustedes y por siempre, por siempre os llegar mi voz,
Anda y reza por mi
Still I sit here on this balcony,
In the long grass of evening time
All my thoughts are all lies
A bti mezget chto kogda da-j povezet
I grew up in the scantling yards of Wheeling, West Virginia
Brand new bitch, brand new ride
All I want is some lovin'
I'm holding out my love for you
For you are not alone
We hold each other close, you tell me it's alright
Suede face, beggin' for bones
Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night
It might not hurt this much to say goodbye
I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle
People come to haggle and paw on my artwork
Why don't you keep firing at the bonny black hare?"
Well they stretched him out and they tailed him down while the iron was gettin' hot
Her lips are like some roses fair
I don't know what to do.
That she makes me think, makes me think,
I'm so selfish, paying your rent
When a man ain't got no freedom the time sure passes slow
It's a trade I got to get money and stand tall
Head on collision, I'm tryna avoid the crash (pain)
Cedo ou tarde encontra o segredo
'Cause when I'm here with you
Only make believe that you love me
A thug changes and love changes
You you'll have to move to Mexico.
We both can see it's meant to be
I gotta get my mind off you,
tell a b-tch to tell her friend
Cause like the sky you have me
But every single bill had Washington's face
Give me all your troubles, I can take the strain,
To a handsome man and baton
You Don't Want It You Don't Know Now
And the world can go it's own way
Well I'm a sucker for fine Cuban cigars
Trying to draw me in
I don't care if your from kansas I'm killin the fuckin chief
Surprise, you're now one of the gang
'Cause I've always had the trouble with authorities
I told him he shouldn't have sent her
It feels so good it can't be wrong.
You left me in yr cell
You know there's no such thing
Kid's don't trick or treat, they get +tricked+ for +treating+
Except for one crazy old man standin' there preachin' in the halls
I'm getting kicks outta this sh*t like it was my sneakers
Please stay away from me you've done far too much harm
This is it, we are, baby, we are one of a kind
Or either in somebody's jail rotten that's my word,
I love the way you do it 'cause you do it so crazy
and i'll wake the dead
So nurse bring me my guitar, one more song before I go
I know I been puffin a lot,
[Note: words in () are sung by Billy]
You'd think by now I could see
Blond bee, find me in the hood with my peoples
FÃ¼r den ganzen dreckigen Rest
Does anybody care? Do you even see?
I am all-souls now decreeing
But it's mine, this is my life
We quick reachers, spear with the fearless til you drip liters
Ich will ein Kind von dir, King Joonge Dner
Well it breaks my heart to see you this way
Just want to spend my time running free
that I'm being fucked up the ass by LIFE!
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show
Home in and drag her, sit wit ya girl and watch me tag her
Making me some hillbilly pay
He drove into her brain
About a man who sold the world away
I've been the star of many plays
They lived for a while in a
Look, whether you like it or not, right in ya spot
After I heard her say "Hello"
Shake that ass, shake that Ass, shake that ass
a last prayer for nothing
You gotta have a gimmick
Well, he was jealous, he was jonesin'
Why do the winds of change carry us away?
And I'm a hit it with the icky cream
Hopes dies out and we can see the end.
'Cause it's a Mr. like you
Til we drink the oceans dry
We listen to the folk songs
(What do you want from me)
Cause Lovin' You Aint That Hard
Something you dreamt of, but now I know its all just lies
Aburrida me encuentro esta noche
This is all that we want
you know me, you said you were stuck back there,
Vielleicht stehe ich vor dir,
They're bashing sexuality and cashing in on bigotry
(This is dead stock and it's in your kitchen)
You niggas on the bench
Bear tracks bear tracks lookin' back at me
Feel you live and breathe
It's dog-eat-dog and never give in
ich nehm Dir den Verstand
She waits alone for me to come down
Thought I had nobody to make my house a home
Try and love me, you won't do no good.
Group Round and around and an up and down we go
Perdido del que habla de anetica
But I've learned along the way
But it really gets bad 'round midnight
Just a place to be alone
Won't you tell me your name?
We thought of stopping now
Reminisce on a girl I met
Why is that we keep going?
Hey what's song you whistling
She thinks of when the boy was young
Who's bled the taxpayers of countless funds since our welfare system's existence
All this money I be staring at
I couldn't take it everything that i just heard
Pay the monkey back, back,
La T'arini Bsham El Ward
Now you shut your fucking trap 'cause you was who I's fucking at
I'm not that lonely child - who's fighting for a start
It said one will get you,
I wanna see you Strip
(There's a better world, there's a better world)
And I'm about to explode
Tell me, tell me where you been, nigga
Long we hoped that He might,
so I'm down wit hoe play with my pee pee
He sings each night in some cafe
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
The temple stein o' Fyvie
I'd give you everything and more and that's for sure
Got a ticket to a show
So I bought a blindfold and medical tape.
Ou me montrer ce qu'il faut faire pour Ãªtre grand
Came back and I heard that you were through
I want to swim away but don't know how
Well, I don't want to hear your lies
Schau, bei den Menschen ist das manchmal kompliziert
I dream of her and there you are
on top of the hill. Yes, we thought it might have
welcome to the home of every fear
His whole life down the drain
It shouldn't take too long, to set the thing moving
Take me by the hand, take me somewhere new
daar pas ik voor zolang ik kan ga ik
I painted up my face, I always do I'm a Clown
And will you ever change?
If we own the night
SÃ¥ vi to er ikke til at brÃ¦kke en flis af
And with the speed I'm running though the night keeps coming
I spend it when I whip that
Don't wait for us to be dead and gone.
I'll leave you in the rain
Entao planto meu legado pra que voce esteja ligado e que o futuro tenha fartura e que seja regado
Until the morning we were side by side
Make the biggest scene, make the biggest
try to step on me baby
But you keep me hangin' on your lonely wire
cul esta mas a la moda van lucindose
Mountains wear a cloak of gold
To realize just what I have found
I watch the shadows climb the wall
You say you love me, but you always try to change me, girl, ooh.
I turn to find back the words you say
High holdin hammers hectically hittin herbs, homicidin
Half past high noon - Tutankhamen
But it's all a game
And though it'll be easy to stay here
I fail to breathe, escape velocity
I should have stopped by on my way
I'm the man without a name
He hocked his gun and gave the money to the lord
I'm just so drunk and miserable
For you I will always be waiting
I've been living without you
Then comes your moms, your fam is second
But I'm getting closer, getting closer
I'll be your fantasy friend forever, forever!
I done been through the storm now
What go around come around, kid (go around)
Baby, you're so cruel, you're so cruel
Love is wanting what you have
All soup and no fish
I never felt like this before, I never felt like this before
If you aint from there you'll never see
you got somewhere else that you should be
Buried in the work what never ends
Or did you just sit down and cry?
y por los dos sabrs
And I wonder if she ever thinks of me
I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
You are not an enemy anymore
I know that new love thrills me
No second chance at this
If I had one last sunset to see (See)
No, we can't carry this for you
And the only thing to do is try to cover them again
I found someone who really deserves me
If you naw show no progress
Just make me look distinguished
im a ghetto gorilla, Im a..acres home 20 inch chrome dub wheela
Our hearts are on parade
Oh no should I go or will you stay
I don't know where I am
Will ease your pain inside
I don?t care about the altitude, I just want another drink.
Where the fuck you gon' get a job you a predicate
The way you start a fire
I must confess I still believe,
You'd be so nice to come home to
Und wÃ¤rst du schlechte Laune, wÃ¤r ich jeden Tag im Arsch
well he's got a lot to say he says it simple and plain
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
And between reflections I must choose
Seongdo ppaego aechingeuro bulleojwosseumyeon hae
You give them an inch & they be taking the p**s
But on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
What you know about AK's and are-15's
I saw for the first time you're his you're not mine
But you're the first thing I'm gonna remember
And it's whiskey in the shade
Deep within I know that you must run
Third behind my mind is my body
It be that excess drama, wonder rhymer,
They only want to be like you
I love this shit like I say in bed
Nobody knows who did it
I'm as helpless as a ship without a wind,
Then I'll take good care of you
In a cage had to run
Now I got a court date on my way upstate
Get a compact car full of discount tags
Trust in love to faith
If you hesitate, you'll hear the click of the receiver
And said, ?That you were coming back to stay?
When I spoke to you I thought it wil be good
Give me anything even sympathy
In his fear, he dare not face me
now you im lovin every day
Cause it's all without your mind
To love is easy, it ain't easy to walk away.
I found out the hard way
Headlines, wake up, refuse and resist
On stage, I bring about four or five
Who's reachin' out to capture a moment
We stayin' focus while you try to provoke us
All your lies have been baiting me to hook
Always want to have my hands on you
i am hoping through the dark clouds
Every one of those days
If I could let the evil go
I bought you a ten dollar dinner
Un poco loco de todas formas
VÃ¡monos por cheve fria y pasamos por los hielos
Word, I'm bout to get up out of here
She call me baby but I'm not the new year,
They have come and they have gone
Cause I'm here to fulfill you're dreams (cause tonight is meant just for you)
Niggaz'll tell you, that nigga B.Gizzle hold it down
She doesn't seem herself at all
Streets flaunting me, dogs and marijuana don't help
Now I just don`t know who to tell to go to hell
Per sentirlo fino in fondo dentro me
That's the jingle bell, that's the jingle bell
And I hold my tongue when the pain is great
You say its now or never
The armies of doubt were playing war in my head
I can play my music, only way I can
You got the time just go
And if you should fall
And to know tonight you're all alone
I'll carry you burden for certain you have heard
Yo Ninja kook n tekkie
C to the, cold-blooded (na, na-nasty) cold-blooded, hard-core
One day baby, we'll be old
And he never woke up
Try to run up but he's already mine
Swirling around, taking in the scenery
Look at my hands, theyre still full of faith
Only that he loves her so
(... like this,... like that)
They made me see somebody
I was bugging everyone I know
I feel, like the frame
So you women better watch out
When you sleep do you dream of me
That your life's about to start and you just can't wait
How we let the money get between us
Wit no shame give him a year
Memories still bring me a numbness to my feelings
My-i-i-i-i-i, baby, you're my favorite waste of time.
I got one stove, 2 pots, 4 workers, 2 blocks
You know cops are comin' when a brotha smells
You don't need to struggle like you did before
Cause my heart is true
Where we fake it 'til we make it
And what can fuck with this? I take shots and don't fuckin' miss
Your love has left me strangled
Somewhere in the valley of the shadow of death
I don't have to wish upon a star
Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down
Why did you have to hit me like that, mommy?
Until the night time darkness
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
I was afraid - I couldn't hear you,
Too much of a good thing, girl
You should of been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents
I did a bad thing
What it is that I recognize
Boy, you must have gone crazy out there."
Il me revient des tas de choses:
Then through the shadows, I always see.
Throw ya tens up and keep'em right there
One kiss goodnight and she's rolling her eyes
I want to get paid
Until the sun rears its head (you always said "depression falls with the snow")
No matter what I do you love me not
Twoasted, looped, to' back, souped
I'm giving you the x's (x's)
With the weight of the world laid across my back
Yeah the trigger just might get squeezed
would not be here if you were.
Why all these words leave me in doubt
And the cracks in my hips
honja ipgoseo nan lalala honja johaseo nan lalala
im creepin on the low
You told me you were done with her and I believed every word and now I wonder what I heard
And yesterday you were here with me
Well, now they're bursting wide apart
won't put it past ya baby i'm on the level
Like a kid loves candy and fresh snow
It was us against the world
Now get yo' drum on (c'mon and getcha drum on)
we cant give up, woah oh
Looks like you're my baby now
Oh dear heart I know it's been a long time
Mas no discutas, que conosco tus bajos inicios
is like a dream without an end
Yeah uh I am a scientist
Neck full of Gold Olympian shit
Brass: I flip my wig
Or on the trigger of your gun
And you know I don't usually do this
Cuz this Naomi flowin show gets pretty lonely
Take a walk with me
That won't touch back again 'til the job is done
Leave my keys in the door
Was it Your voice, saying "Here I am"?
then i'll let you down!
Driving into the sunshine, driving into the sunshine
You see the stars far away
This world was never kind
Who'd love to be kissing me, hugging me, holding me tight
Messing me 'round and 'round
It's alright I know you love me
All I can do is pray
And it's in your hands
Without the "bah diddy bah" I couldn't go and cash checks
So I'm writing you a chorus
Come back to me, it's almost easy
You're looking cold and tired
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Heroin bein consumed already predicitin my doom, soon
And just ate the knife
Ed io ci credo, ma non ti vedo
That cuts just like a knife in my heart
Purple drink we the Lakers
Come get money with me if you curious to see
Take her to the spot.
Touch my very soul makes me lose control
I'm looking out for you, yeah,
I went from a hardtop to a convertible like Imma transformer,
Peepin for Sax so we can creep it on the humble
Love at first, baby, let your hair down
Hay algo entre tÃº y yo
Where the lights don't stop
Escape for a little while,
And it's all right now
What I've got to debunk
All things beautiful, all things beautiful
But instead they ducking bullets and the niggas that pull it
You want a have a party for life?
You know what I'm saying
While we here lets celebrate
The city cries itself to sleep
In England...In England...In England...In England...
You know I get my money back like its a re-bay
But whatever you do baby
But in the crimson dawn, Black Rose would unfold
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
You know I need it all
Oh you can take a whole lot of sand
You know I need, I need a helpin hand.
But tonight I'm here, yours again
Find another reason why you should pick it up,
I'm tryin' to live my life, so what the fuck is you tellin' me?
harder to kick than you think where a good times still had
Cause I'll just break down these walls,
Mon histoire see'est l'histoire d'un amour
With my eyes close I see there is no competition
for you hold the key to my happiness,
We ain't done yet your pretty silhouette
Rise up - hey, I'm going on
There's room for one more body in our boudoir
Beyond the plain of the valley
Make the money, fuck who tells
So my mama always told me
Too much like him 'til my mama don't love me
The world still turns the sun still shines
I don't believe in anything at all
ë¤ ìì ë  ë°ë ¤ê°
Let me through don't spoil my view
Don't leave me hanging on the wire
We goin' hard until we see the light
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Last night I think I drank too much
You couldn't break up the towers with Tomjanovich
Throw them ones and we meet in the lounge
[Cam'ron] wait, wait, wait rude boy shotas u done see shotas n u done call me with dis Jamacian shit get the fuck out of here man
Till there's nothing left inside your head
I'm runnin' round here, I'm looking for that pot of gold
All the memories going round, round, round, round
Kelis used to bring them lil boys right in the street,
All lone I gaze at the sea faithfully
Ooh baby it feels like, it feels like
How long its been going on
What did I do wrong
To hear your voice above the noise
I see you tryin' to hide that fire inside
I know I'm wastin' my time
She must have felt the stirrings of passion,
'Cos I'll be getting mine
And now el seor F
Yo it's about to go down
Android dog bit off my leg
Rushing through the busy town
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
It all seems so stupid
I elongated my lift home
Y a pesar de que voy perdiendo
Wanna feel your teeth on my neck
Come on baby have a taste with me
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Same place you front's where you get laid at
And if it wasn't for bad, I had no luck at all
And today well, it's been one of those days
some cums thick and some cums silky
And they should scatter flowers at her feet
In the local underground music scene
Don't be mad at me
Hoy hay sÃ³lo un gran silencio
And you're picking up debris from the hurricane
If I catch you talking to that boy again,
How we long for a life as a slave
A million times a day I will send them through
I wish I still had something better to do
Why you always talking shit
Don't be afraid let it all go
What am I doin' here?
But I know how you can get dude right back
Oh I-I'm the one who's here tonight
We won't rot alone the ones we hate
When there's got to be
and he thanks god for what hes got
But I think this is it for us
With too much time on my hands,
its just the storm before the..
Killers hustlers and thieves remember that
Want to walk on water
Oh the simple country boy to a life of disgrace
I sing my song for you
But it's alright, thrills will fade
If I cry out in this darkness
I'll never drink again if you just let me live
Focusing it on the sky as 99 red balloons go by
Corners me in dead-end streets (loneliness)
Think hard, there gotta be another way to get you a green card
There's something you gotta see
(This time we let y'all know how we switchin' it up on y'all hoes)
For sure the pen's mightier than the sword
Blick von oben - fuÌhl mich federleicht.
It's been a long time I shouldn't have left you
All my love (let's me free)
They wounds around the neighborhood
And we're caroling through the night
I sweatin tears until I'm free
Qu'ensuite on sera assez forts
And make you motivate, and accelerate
I'd know just what to do
Gotta Take A Plane Without You
The only high I get, is when my fans yell HOE
Like the party's on, they keep on knocking
Write a letter to the Queen
And when before the throne
I wanna dance till my body ache
The sun comes up each day
Do not lean over the ledge
Don't let Beverly kill you too
It's all going by us too fast
Taking you by the heart
Speak it and it's done
Alone and yet perfectly whole,
Scooping up Chris and I'm hitting the freeway
The jury had ruled it was self-defence
y si no hay dinero me paga con cal
Yet through the world alone I wander for I know somewhere
And the future seemed so very far away
Something about hotel rooms and horses
I walked miles of barbed wire, use a cobra snake for a necktie
We could say that we've got each other.
Ah the show was phat, now it's back to the room, G
I go with the flow
All black my whip foreign, these bad hoes keep tiptoeing
And the brown earth bleached white
Shit on Worldstar, man, you really made it
Let me know Your every command
But happen less and less
Grammar god, swing like gold from panama
Get buck in this bitch!
Can (I didn't know what it means)
Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin laid an egg
Solo la luna como ninguna
N****z dyin so be ready for whatever
Ali made it happen, gave me some shine
The nights over kid, I'm stilI gettin spliffted
I might just break the chain
Um Dich kampfen bis zum Schmerz
Jack talking (Jack talking to you)
I want to look and feel your touch, ooh
But when I'm down and feeling blue,
Have I got some blues for you
It's just a name, a name, a name, a name, what's in a name?
Get outta my head or into my bed.
(What you do to me)
I want a fine young gal that is so nice and free
'Cause I won't let you go without a fight.
The rarest gem of everlasting life
Don't you ask me to come out
Oh let the light shine down on Phoenix when it rains
Talk all day, tell me all your stories
And I know that l will run, yes I'll run to him
Jer ja moram drugoj poc
Either you learn to adapt or you're sealin your fate
With rosy cheeks and grassy knees their life is heaven sent
Yeah, this one's for you and everything you do
I said oh, is that your first impression
And if I have to wait
But I thought "Fuck it"
And let's spark a new flame
So many things that she wishes
Only trouble is, gee whiz
'Cause if you're gonna love me and leave me hanging here
And led me through that door again
I thought by now you'd understand
Why I should feel this way [2x]
Kids and dogs runnin' by
She's got lots of opinions which she expresses honestly
Watch the rage that I pull, finna' unleash this cage
I walked away from the chance of a lifetime
Various, chickens they wanna marry us
I was worried and upset about what I'm gonna do without your genre acceptance.
Snoop Dogg, Snoop Doggy Dogg, what's up?
the girls are almost naked
I am longing for ignorance and bliss
Ha ha yeah, huh, uhh
I see death around the corner
Ooh, I was so mad
King & queen of America
Everywhere you go you always take the weather
She shed a tear and said she never wanna let me leave
God bless you workin on a plan to heaven
que llevarÃ© por siempre en mi es real
'Cause you can feel bad these days for free
(this is for the heavyweights)
And that girl up in the front row screaming my god
To be cat and mouse for the champions
Are you that lonely ghost on the side?
Love is a burning thing
Oohhh, when I'm around you I'm predictable
If you were here with me tonight
Now do you want my love
If I give my heart to you tonight
Maybe I'll see you if I can
And in the morning when she leaves
Were in the same race
But to love her is to need her everywhere
A way that we could listen to the warning signs so pay attention
Don't you think you are to blame?
But it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still
And lift my song into the air
I was searching for some legal document
That's right, I'm on those
The strands in your eyes that color them wonderful
(And the bottom drops out)
And I think It's so impressive I'm riding in the back
'Cause I'm that kind of girl
They ain't nothing but influences, bad influences to me, ya know
And there's a lot of parts on me that don't work no more..
When you get lost in the crowd
But you know that it ain't the same
I got yo front, you got...
Killing my heart I can't face I can't face no more, the world is my playground too I can't feel anymore.
I would do anything for us to make it through
It was whiskey and sad country songs
Well, the animals a-boogied all over the place
Wird er dann ganz allein steh'n
You put me in a fever 50 stories high
There's no one to help you there
Make ya sing till ya a la la la la la la la tdow!!
Talk about making it something real
All you do is bring me pain, Boy you crazy, pain, pain
A genius of the night
Tell all of your friends goodbye
(All I want is a girl like you)
Ich lad' dich ein auf meine Party die das Leben ist
Ich will wieder an die Nordsee, ohoho
That you're playn' a game
Scene by scene of my whole life
It's not a game, no fad or fashion
aim it to the left, a little low, son, aim it to the left, a little low
She don't love you, Ooh Ooh,
I play the game, but to my real shame
Play that funky music say it, say it, say
I'd like to get a suntan
But you won't look like me
Le temps a rendu le monde petit
So get to it, yeah yeah yeah
So get on the top
For my physical ,and my entire flipmode squad
If you say what you mean, and you mean what you say.
Was it love at first sight? (nope)
Ol' G, big homey, the one and only
On the door it said good riddance
They call me show stopper
Hard as I might try
Ain't feeling like a man
back and forth, t.v. to school, there's not much else you know
And when I fall flat I'll smile
It's just a sad song
Is this the vibe you desire? (You know you're on time)
To say just what I mean
I got them keys, keys, keys
and keep it rising high
Cause they got the guts to get out in the strees and tell the truth every day aahh yes
Wasn't quite what I had been thinking of
Des fois je ralentis et je relativise, pense Ã  ce que peut ressentir un amÃ©rindien
I made up my mind to go
Then came the man with a suit and a tie
He drinks a vodka drink
Makes us feel creative in a life minus creation
But I like the way you fuck me
Simjangsoriga neoege deullil deusi keojine yeah
Cause you come and go again like the tide
Why don't you run back to school
You don't need no coffee, let me, fill your cup
Now you've put me in my place
And if you start going to school and you're serious about my daughter
That every time I see you my heart sings
'Cause when push comes to shove, love can't be undone
and in the morning kick me in the head
Many sleep in the rain, but I'm awake in the storm
While riding with the engineers
I never felt such emotion
Bow Wow Wow yippie yo, yippie yay
And we exalt Your Name
Help me rejoice and fill that prayer with love
'Cause Most he be mega
Everydays changing will remain the same.
Let's escape from this fading world
Tuer le temps, tourner ma veste, les uns s'en vont, les autres restent.
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself
Give yourself to the world, baby girl
Almost better to be safe than sorry
For the dreams that never will come true
You've got a friend in me
God knows what he said...
Them stacks is fallin', they back to ballin'
It's the perfect confusion or the realist illusion,
Oh it's my time and I can't waste it
He washed his hands and he
Niggas, acting like I won't give up a habit
city lights got her spinin
Don't you know things can change
You can spend your whole lifetime
Kotoba ni deki nai mama de
She Blowin Up A Nigga Sidekick
Just can't wait to get in line
Turn that cherry out, turn that cherry out
and the way she would look at me - and the way she would do this
Nigga, I hit em' up
We seek retribution for the crimes
Where the high custodian my bet
what goes up must never come back down
Jay-Rock nigga and I do it for my [Cali Niggas]
Bullets they fly, niggas they die
Somethin somethin strange, somethin strange
And people who live in glass houses
Cause nothing really matters anyway
"Yes Deltron, what have you?"
When it's right in the palm of your hand
Shakes me like I'm not shaken before.
A fairy tale a piece of fiction
Wie kann man nur mit weißen Kleidern
Got a villa full of young Dons
my mom took your place and still did hers
You never had your picture on the wall
And if you love me you've got to love me right
All I really worry about is living it and killing it
With your badge and rubber boots
Babe, I don't know what to do
Baby, don't be such a baby
For three nights in a row
Junge Menschen sagen âIch will SpaÃ"
I will never share my world with anyone
That all of us, we share
Once I had a trick up my sleeve
Years and Years and ya can't get rid of me
Ran back to Fox, found Martin, me and Bruhman from the fifth floor
But then one day my Uncle Sam
We've lost count up victims roll call
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
I expect love from you
One and one is nothing
Echoing an elitism that poisons you
A dog, a bank account managed by mickey mouse
Cause I'm a hoodlum, a monster, Bad Boy, a goodfella
Because me and my homie really don't give a fuck.
He jerked out his gun and said mister are you crazy,
And perfect's what you see,
I said hush little baby don't you cry
I'm still spotted from the stain
Such a long, long, long, long time before the dawn
They'll let me in, from the cold.
You don't bang huh? That's that out of town in you
