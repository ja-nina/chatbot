it just really grabs your attention it just makes the whole place seem like that
okay uh Utah has a a good school system where uh
yeah one one way or another
what kind of meals did she make that you liked
i do watch Northern Exposure and also for for ever how many years it's been on TV i've been watching Knots Landing
everybody likes his speed but he can't catch the ball
and everything i think gee you know they'll never get this worked out it just seems like they they delay it more and more every time they have a launch
be there when that was being created instead of being sustained and you know y- you can't have uh a quarter of the economy resting on one little project up there
yes there's a lot of times when you need some of that but the idea of of having nothing else is what's uh unfortunate yeah
uh well qualify that she worked at home i'm sure
uh probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have how about_1 you
but trade a year
you know we don't have that much of it now as long as we have plenty of vegetables and lots of chicken
i thought well golly gee she's got to be lying i'd say i slept with him for a hundred thousand bucks you know
i think it's interesting and
they certainly keep things uh neat and clean things stay away
"uh i wasn't with GSI but i was connected with uh"
when you have the big old trees
but we you know we since paid it off and
if he finds some things in in there then they will proceed to your house perhaps and uh say open your door up and go in and search your house and after that they can enter at any time
you know a bigger issue as you know the medical profession continues to you know increase longevity
you too and uh have a good day
no i don't think so because_1 uh i saw just a little bit of the game today and he was out there playing
but uh news wise that way no
i can understand that i it's not the most fun in the world but
but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same so i- i think most of them_1 are
do you worry that we might uh overs- i guess my question is do you do you think that there are ways that we might over- overstep our bounds and provoke uh
i have a cat uh my parents have a cat
Tauruses over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips uh as rental cars and i've always been very impressed
well just recently we've we've found out that um
and "i get mail"
do you think it would be a deterrent
so who knows maybe this'll get me to do it you don't have children
or eliminate it entirely for a few years until we get our own house in order
well i uh to answer that one before we get to our subject you know i always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that
oh you don't know what happens after they get in school
well then what happens in the UN Russia supposedly gets the Soviet Union's seat and what happens with the eleven other republics i guess they don't get anything who knows
um because it is so you know it a friend of mine wen- traveled to Belize and and into Honduras hello
i imagine that keeps you busy
right right yeah but i agree with you though they uh they're trying to uh you know they're they're saying that you are guilty until proven innocent and uh and i don't really appreciate that at all
but um if you want to take them all to one place they have uh the first Saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them_1 off that's what i do um
um education i got a double major
i have a a similar opinion at first i
as i uh went along when i started uh at first i had to uh i didn't have to use my arms all that much to uh you know get the heart rate up "but then after about uh"
that can that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day or more in school
it too it's it was a large transition let me tell you because_1 they had to meet one person they only had to meet me and i had to probably meet twenty five or thirty people
and my lawn is very green and my flowers are still blooming
uh they had some activity they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff and
uh i need to get into voting i've never voted
well i don't know if i've done it quite that much but uh
uh well uh just really the last couple of days since this uh the UN
even banana if you can do it just before you leave it stays nice and fresh
i- i- i- i think that that we don't want to go to the extreme of banning them completely but we sure want a lot of control then and a lot of protection
um yeah just a second
do you have a favorite television program
my sister-in-law always brings to family dinners is a
yeah i'm again- i'm against this uh automatic and semiautomatic stuff i don't think we should have access to those
oh yes Jessica Tandy won best actress and uh say
i do i was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing um
let's put him into a situation where okay you crossed the line you broke the rule you're going to have to pay for it
well that that's fairly good do you get paid once a month or by twice a month
yes But i think that's almost impossible next to impossible
but it's usually the Prime Minister right it's Thatcher Major
and uh on non visitor days people dress down and they wear just slacks and dress shirts
that is true that is absolutely true or you're gonna make a fool out of yourself or trip over somebody's feet
yeah that's exactly right
is what the government does
of course my dad is a big sailor "so he likes to sail and he likes to do all that stuff but it's been a long time since he's had a boat"
and it will depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update
so i don't know it's it's uh quite a situation i
well there are all different kinds there
oh that poor child
than the intensive eye
was it in the tire business again or
but the one thing too that that i have a problem with is that well if marijuana and cocaine and the other those so-called uh illegal drugs you know what about alcohol
uh-huh you just do it
took that uh went to war with Iraq i think we that was kind of a uh display of power
yeah my mother's seventy now so naturally she's retired but she's still on her own i mean you know
um they had a gardener
um each side has three bedrooms two baths living room and then a big uh kitchen that has uh dining area in it
and to you know get rid of some of the atrocities that were going on
but it's like it's English but it's not the same English they speak today so
yeah i- i guess it depends on the facility it's going to the thing that i guess the flip side of that and
so there's like a core of like each station has like two or four full-time then everybody else is a volunteer
i can remember as a kid growing up my whole family all my family grew strawberries grew excuse me grew tomatoes
you know those kinds of things uh we don't have a lot of uh
just Dallas in general i don't know i think back of when i was uh younger and in my party days some of those things
oh no that throws the budget out of whack real fast
so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't
and i'm putting myself through college and like i'm getting married in October my fiance and i are paying for most of the wedding
but lots of times getting down to the actual method and and results
for them to get
and whether we like it or not when
well uh the trends in the families were to spread apart do your own thing but i have seen lately yes i am seeing
i can see the results of that
and um especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses i
yeah that's a factor
what is that called the [Judo-Christian/Judeo-Christian] ethic Judeo-Christian ethic
take a responsibility for
you know what i'm saying i don't think most people understand what he's talking about when he talks about that new world order
by Bly B L Y i believe it is
tagging them_1 to share the cost of
oh i uh i didn't know that somebody could avoid Workmen's Compensation
are not as good
you know that's those kind of items like that wear items there's no way you can judge
undergraduate school a long long time ago i uh noted that the monthly salary starting average monthly [saly/salary] salary for engineers that in my discipline was like
yeah you really do
well i know even if you watched ABC NBC or or the other y- i mean what's the other one uh CBS they all were were tapped into CNN
yeah nice talking to you
yeah it'd be nice if you could find someone
you know Karen i wonder if we are recording
um yeah we've i mean it you know there's you have all sorts here too um
um you know in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents "um" it's just like the way it it has been for years i mean you know
but it i- it works out nicely and i don't know you know i think i'd do that even if i wasn't remarried if i had thought about it
it increases each year i think
again before you go you know tha[t's]- that's why i said when they first started it they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and if you may have taken drugs
yeah i don't know why they did i never did hear anything at all about it all of a sudden it was just gone
anyway so they could really only have four members on the team i think they only have four boys i don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet
yeah well yeah they like coming into the house but they were going cr- crawling up our building up into the eave where it was warm
i- i think it is too And i and i think things like eggs and cheese anything like that i think it just depends on who you are
they divide it one way and the minorities say we're losing representation representation
yeah well that's that's part of it the tradition certainly modifies it if you have uh tradition of of um like
it's enough space for two people
Texas is a big state
yeah well i guess it kind of borders on where
um i watched the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands it started out just being a terrible place for the people and then a new company bought it
yeah i can imagine
i think that i should have a right to own a handgun not a automatic semiautomatic
and i can see that point but i also have this you know i
right i don't know how sound that is perhaps your way is is a is a more sound proposition you know
and i'm not sure what it is i just remember seeing a uh kind of a synopsis of it
absolutely that's what my wife and i do on Fridays you know we uh meet at five thirty and uh go to the movie and then go out an- go to dinner somewhere then come home
well my husband does not like to commute very far and and we don't like him to be you know having to drive an hour to work or
uh to have anything to turn to when you got when you've got something facing you like that
and they're trying to get the value out of the homes so they subdivide around here they'll put a million dollar home on a half acre lot
but there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change so we have to uh face that reality also
help out the working people right now the middle income people uh give them_1 some tax credits i think they've done that i seems like i remember that happening once in my past i'm in my forties and i
it's not not called Tetris you know it's like uh-huh
have to take her to see that
his idea of music is not quite the same as my idea of music
and and or or send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal
so i want to get a new uh four eighty six chip but i don't
and that is yeah he's a little yeah anyway um and that was just
um-hum um-hum yeah but
right i can't stand that
we have a few Exxon we've got some other ones like Citgo
believe me you don't need to
now i think my m- mechanic found a way to do that there's a switch somewhere that you can push that uh pop the light up without turning it on
yeah see my oldest is four
you kn- come to think of it it's that way around here too i mean you know there there's nothing even vaguely resembling hills around here
well now if you don't take any magazines why would you why would you want to talk about magazines
she can talk you into that most a lot of women
and uh now that was very competitive
and i think some of the laws that they're trying to pass right now um
uh-huh it was in high school
they had the snow plows and the salt trucks and and uh they just you know they were equipped for it whereas here
it's it's amazing that uh you know like prior to like nineteen twenty there were n- very few heart attacks
yeah where you felt like you were
oh and then they wouldn't sink they were floating around so they shot holes in them to sink them and this is before i was born
uh the question is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations and you know the in their in the society we live in what do you think has occurred there
yeah let's hope it happens ag-
and then harvest like in December
okay_1 well do you have a pet
"what all do you know about it"
it's it's staggering when you think that just
and getting the kids computer literate earlier you know my kindergartners were on the were on the computers and i think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done
and uh you know it is kind of sad to see all these people that you know have the
a- as we did and as we sold arms to "pardon me to Iraq when we wanted them to fight Iran" and then uh and then it turned around and
but instead i go out and buy toys and things oh um but
and there's always a lot of snow in fact where i grew up we were about_1 an hour's drive from seven to uh twelve different major ski resorts
i have to really do the research to find out
you know for the asphalt so they're gonna you know trash out
"i stopped worrying about money" and uh never have worried about money since then
oh i watched that movie with um
they're about uh an hour or two drive from the ocean for the coast
yes even at a discount store i've looked at them and they're about eighteen ninety for one of them so uh that's why i say i can't quite
that's one thing down here we certainly have a problem with overcrowded prisons
uh in which leadership is the key element
i don['t]- i can't think off my head do you know which one yours was
heavy duty restrictions that's i feel in favor for because you just can't be handing these things out to anybody
and what's the name of your company you know and this by this time they're really shook up and then um
oh you're in school
mostly from three or four areas
i think first degree murder um
with uh Anthony Quinn i thought it was i like everything he's done so far
i made some of them_1 with that hair and then uh
what that whole system is going to look like because that's that's our choice now too that's that's our cause
because that's the hand you use i guess to to wipe your butt after you do your job
boy i'll say that's right my with our well wh- with all of them_1 we start right from the time they were born and and spent time reading with them_1 and
and uh so i really enjoyed that
and then at that point
but uh especially on the airplane part of it because_1 you know they there there's a lot of potential for you know uh hijackings and things like that terrorist attacks
i was gonna ask next how she was familiar with where everyone was
probably uh uh about_1 twenty
are these yeah yeah i was going to say they're getting to the age where you can you can kind of trust that a little bit yeah
well uh i "i was just talking to my dad about that just a couple of weeks ago and i think i think it'd be great that we went to it"
now i'll have to watch one of yours and see if i like it all right it was good talking to you bye-bye
you don't have a
but it does serve as a pun- uh definite pun- you know lasting punish-
well yes i i well i- i don't think i have the time to really become a student in every article
a lot of them_1 a lot of airplanes a lot of ground forces
it'll never be elevator music let's put it that way
well they have a lot tighter controls on importing things of that nature too you can't get them_1 through airports uh
and this it wa- he was an experimental government thing you know
and you take care
goes back into the county that you live in
if you ever start be sure and start with a large piece that you can "i mean a large flat plate hm"
that's kind of what i've
that does sound like fun well i've gotten some good ideas from you
the hygienic care and everything that she needed
it was never my own car it was always someone else's
and and play a little bit mostly uh it's mostly remedial work for us we we we're both out of shape
no um not since um
uh UTEP like i say is doing real well and it's it's too bad that they have something like that did they restrict the
and that that way those who want it can have it and those who don't want it don't have to have it
i went on jury duty here not long back
i had to decide either i was gonna just quit all that mess and go study or or or you know just basically skin through
um do you like i mean what is it about uh the the kind of restaurants you go to that you like i mean what makes you like i said what makes you want come back
well yeah it's not that far
improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them_1 get into uh management
that's not good well my my little dog has a playmate from uh down the street and we have play appointments and play days where
then then they kick it off
uh Junior yeah yeah ours is a Commodore 128
well what some of you have heard some of you haven't i think it's just it's it's pretty much every
if he's president if you don't get a job within two years then you're taken off welfare
yeah and they they um they um i mean last year was just fantastic with the Giants winning the Super Bowl it was just
so that's that's what i thought was interesting that uh there are still drugs out there and then there are those socially acceptable drugs
yes i went uh four years undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln because Lincoln is where where my parents lived and there really
definitely through North Africa and uh within parts of the Middle East as well something which terrifies the moderate Arab states
i don't know if the camping that i've done is is really roughing it without a a whole lot of stuff
you know self uh
i just going to say nineteen eighty four is come and is come and gone but it's here
i don't know that that would be a good environment to work in i mean i
and the the attachment i kept on stripping the the ratchet uh head
it's been it's been one thing after another going wrong that the local dealer
our uh the house next door to us burned a few years ago but
oh it's beautiful it's really beautiful my girlfriend was down there a few first time she's been down there and they wanted to take that drive and they had closed the whole road because o- of fog yeah
we've got a case going here where a man is accused of poisoning his wife with arsenic now and the jury the case went to the jury today and the jury's deliberating right now
but uh we have a family dog that uh ate all of the children's toys
so uh what do you wear to work
um how much it costs the employers and a a lot of them are going to their own insurance now
oh uh-huh well i've seen the afghans in the in the
okay i'm i'm a single parent so i- i guess i have to do a lot of cooking for my son and i
you know as far as any maintenance on my car that i shy away from the oil changes that's for sure
yeah i yeah i- i- i think you're right there and i'm glad you mentioned the League of Women Voters i've
oh a a school administrator well that could that would have been interesting
and i sell Stanley products
i mean just really great you know that they were really enjoying
but they retest the same sample
yeah really i can't ever think of when you would use that huh
its amazing how many cans you go through
yeah you've got to have one
yeah it's amazing um i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough i mean to be doing what they're doing
and i finally decided i didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move so this year i i tried KinderCare and then she's old enough to
just a few i made two bears this Christmas uh not out of furry but you know out of the Christmas kind of fabric um
all spoil him you know and he [key/he] likes it watching them play and everything but uh
that that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost
-kay basically i can tell you that i like just about every music there is except for uh uh real hard hard rock i really can't get into that but
right and i- i- i mean i don't know how how old your mom is she's probably let's see my mother's in her early sixties so
yeah uh she had a hard time getting a few folks uh i thought well every all these TIers have gone home uh at one o'clock on Friday
um-hum i think that that they're well they have to be related
on he can't hear me i- i don't remember how many people but it's it's got me- men and women and it's not
if you're going to give the man the death sentence don't keep the guy on death row for eight nine ten years and make him worry about it
"but you know the[re's]- there's the difference because_1 uh they say you know"
a Bombay looks uh i guess the closest thing to describe it to is you have seen the caricatures of Halloween cats
certain chemicals but everybody is so chemical shy anymore that we steered clear of it and hopefully you know come s- come spring it will be cleared up and everything will be back to normal
it kind of surprises you you know
yeah it's alright uh i haven't seen one down here i think where there was one in in Memphis when we was there
uh-huh nice talking to you okay thanks talk to you later bye
"and uh -til next time"
okay what do you think are some current trends in uh the way families spend time together
i haven't been but i've heard it's wonderful
if y- you know instead of
no they're you -ow wh-
well uh my my my ex
even if you're an engineer by training that can be a little tricky [laughter-can't]
i don't know i- i guess i'm satisfied i don't uh
put them_1 together and go and interface the stuff with our systems and
no i don't think so and i've often wondered why haven't you you know i
i'm driving tomorr- i'm i'm driving home tomorrow so to go be there for the Fourth of July
you know where that is
uh well at the time i was uh thinking of going premed and in the state uh they had the best premed uh curriculum for the
uh-huh well we're not all like that um
and uh enhanced with uh uh
yeah i guess we should've tried the pound but the humane society uh wasn't interested in giving us a pet so
it would be great i mean
well hi i guess uh
yeah but there's a lot of we we're just having lots of fun with with our little girl right now um she has lots of toys got little
besides your initial deductible that's what varies the most i guess uh
Wall Street Journal uh interview with a family there and
do uh d- does this school your son goes to do they uh re- required to wear a uniform or
yeah i'm pretty much the same way you know people always say wow th- the meanings of those words and i'm always meaning there's wor- well you know i just thought they just all sort of rhymed you know
or you know if if some some group just isn't gonna play anymore they'll just give us their music and that type of thing
you know up that that high
well i agree with it wholeheartedly the only thing is i've got to share with you and my background is from New Jersey
we do the same kind of things though we've been concentrating on outside lately trying to do some gardening and uh planting a lot of trees and flowers
play in the band on Monday nights and keeps you out of trouble that way
and if you know
i guess i kind of do a similar thing more m- uh medium or longer range i just have a
there may be some schools you could read about and learn
real small they're maybe about oh two inches long they're real small they're real tiny they're cute they really are cute
right on what Thursd- Thursday
what does she do when she loses her patience
yeah i think i'll take the area with trees yeah yeah
um-hum yeah and and i tell you the you know it's expensive
but uh it it does make a difference in your pay wage income i think it's what they want out of life
and you live in Richardson my wife just made her call she talked to someone in Pla-
and the you you made the right choice in going to a school that met all of your needs to make to give you the the potential to do whatever you wanted
yeah w[e're]- we're just kind of like losing and it it just seems to be a snowball effect i mean you know we keep losing more
yeah they are and uh
and then the English equivalent that's uh is put into parenthesis for reference
you've got the real wow far out
we use to didn't eat them_1 i mean i guess i could be thankful for that
paying for these kids she's she's had to back to work part-time
well i could do it now but she gets lonely in the morning and i feel better um she has a crazy father out there somewhere that i just don't let her out of my sight so
would they essentially in terms of mag- magnetism would they go like reverse polarity there so you'd actually get pushed along or would it be actually a draw
and that's you know that's the way they wanted to do it and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he uh you know some people on the case were
and then lets me go and i mean i did not do poorly i finished with a two five that's not that wonderful either
non name brand stuff so
just to survive and then there th- is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that um
it's a it's a lot of fun you just you have to be careful so you don't like go lopping your fingers off or anything
when he can take a sandwich you
uh get much out of that
oh just recently i got married and we bought a house we're about fifty yards from the golf course but unfortunately the house is taking up my time
um i don't even think running t- to the running of
and she would push you know she was hey let's go do it and you know she wouldn't take no for an answer
um a little bit but um a lot of the um music i don't know about uh as far as the titles and i have to listen to it and and figure out what i'm listening to
yeah but uh no i used to uh you know think that golly it'd be great to uh
well i'm uh i'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force and so i travel a lot and yeah i'm a engineer at uh at the laboratory Rolm Laboratory Griffis Air Force Base up here so
a a world council
uh yeah all he liked was the lights this year so
better i don't want to say better it's kind of obvious but do you think time with one parent like if you were off doing something and your wife was doing something with the kids that
oh he's highly upset he uh went on uh
uh i'm concerned in the medical field
um what about glass
uh uh i think and uh
oh i like it so much better it makes it so much lighter you know it really um
well because it's you know the Indians i don't think they pay tax
and i am finding i although i don't sell group insurance or major medical i sell supplemental health i'm finding that every place i go to talk to them about my product
right another belt line just uh farther out go
uh well the birthday was today and tomorrow one of our nephew's one of my nephew's is getting married so
do you remember how many miles you had on it in the at the end
smaller town smaller school
of good directions turning
she said this is home huh
i'm not sure what the answer there is
right right not something you'll you'll uh be interested in ten years from now by any means
well see when i was oh about i guess about ten years ago fifteen years ago
after you have been on this
a deposit on it and even like the you know a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it but if it's got soda in it it does so it's a strange
that doesn't have all that citrine in it and i think that is what the uh people are so opposed to with with the fruitcake
but we wasn't allowed to touch it and Lord help us if we did
i missed that one of eighty or eighty two or eighty one that had the heat wave
oh sure oh sure
i don't get down there very often
we're s- we are still the biggest ones
and he spends well right now he's down to like once a week but he was going over there several times a week to meet with the family and help them with the language and he thoroughly enjoyed it
we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet
my impression is that he's a pretty honest person
and my wife was the cat lover and w- when we started out as a y- young married couple we just had an apartment so y- it's kind of easier to have a cat
uh oh i'm i generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays and Neal uh
they wrote into the Constitution a protection against judicial mishap
i'd say right around six maybe seven years and they're um
the detectives the homicide detectives and so forth when they're researching when they are gathering the evidence they're they're bending over backwards uh
"until you leave you're" you're competing against somebody else or you're competing against uh a system or or something you know and then
it's more rural uh it use to be use to be a uh
i figured there was nowhere i was to late to go that i didn't have twenty more seconds
yeah i know it i've never seen him in anything bad yet
right and you're pay for it eventually
i like silly ones compared to now i like um Perfect Strangers
oh yes uh well you too you too thank you um-hum bye bye
you can go over there and buy an income tax package that will run on a personal computer
the one two weeks ago and just had a horrendous week and i was just so stressed it wasn't even funny and i just could not possibly make it that that Wednesday and then this last Wednesday
how you can borrow money off a credit card i still haven't quite figured that out
yeah i think that it's just a witch hunt and that the people being hit the hardest are the ones that cause the least impact something like eighty percent
yeah i'm sure that's true i'm sure that's true
yes and um so but
um in California yeah
do people change out these things before they fail or
i mean i understand that they're talking about the job not the person in the job that's that's always
yeah that was really dramatic they were
no is what's the death penalty in Mississippi
do you pay a state income income tax
you know it wasn't anything spectacular
i i've got uh
well do you guys go camping or anything like that
but i guess when i hear whe- when i see the comparison between the United States and uh any other western country
that i've watched because i haven't had T got TV Guide around here in ages
look at what happened just in Washington alone God
i haven't i've been i've most of my vacationing in the US has been on the West Coast
but i did want to go to school did want to get the you know go ahead and get the college
uh i have no problem with it
um basically it's lined up blacks versus whites and there've been a lot of murders and mostly boyfriend girlfriend type of thing
yeah i do i own a um i own an i an an X T clone it's a Samsung and uh with a Hyundai monitor monochrome monitor that i just keep at home for work
very nice we had company very nice
and it's a lot cheaper
i mean to say that the quote assault rifle is
i know my shepherd did an- it
what s- what part of the country are you from
right you talking about special projects in the U- in the US you mean now
that's yeah they probably couldn't do anything monetary but i think giv- giving some kind of college credit
nonconcern for human life
but it's fun having four wheel drive capability and a rugged suspension like that to go out and do things
i like more comic than
a lot of the sensors that go there
the next thing you know you know it's lunchtime he's got to stop for lunch and you just holler at your wife to make you a sandwich
uh don't watch much TV don't have enough time
or a place th- where they can run
uh there supposed to be uh some people f- moving down here from Colorado Springs for TI
"i try not to um"
i'm single i have no
so Massachusetts is probably like like i said the best of what i seen there
have to include some fruit of some kind i prefer berries uh like sugared grapes and things that are very attractive to set out on a on a table
well well uh Kirk is capital punishment is that like death death yeah right uh-huh uh-huh
i could sure tell the difference though after the first year or so of being there uh prior to
it must stay light out there pretty well
you know it's very interesting my uh father and i built a a home a uh new home for ourselves from basically from the ground up when i was a teenager
yeah you know the people have a right to know except about what it about what concerns them
well what are we going to do about it How i mean how can it be changed
yeah yeah so that oh okay i'll guess i'll do something like that but um
i think we're going to see a generation of kids that you know are just going to be a little bit um oh not very nurturing i think
but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement uh you know once you get passed thirty three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation
uh that's one thing i've never really feared um "uh i a lot of the my family"
well that's good that's neat
we've gone too far to the left it's fixing to come back hard right
well that's a thought i hadn't thought about doing that
Dekalb yeah Dekalb and Fulton
w- we it's pretty dry we get some when it's this rainy but it's nothing like i guess San Antonio summers it's nothing like Houston
just me and my husband
reduce them through legal means i think we ought to just tax them severely
wh- what's gonna happen i mean i i'm afraid for him to go but on the other hand you can't hold them_1 back
are are are you are you also a professor or or do you just research
uh you know it "it really irks me to see" so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the State when they
depending on what industry you get into or whatever like uh you know TI being electronics uh you never get out of school so you know
yeah i i wonder if tha- i wonder if that will uh uh "make things different i've heard that uh"
i think he's the only one that gets paid um
i- i prefer having someone that uh has some knowledge in that and
well that's what we're gonna end up
uh do you see like tho- those overtones i mean couldn't that be like a gospel song you're going to go listen to it and go this girl's really weird but i mean it's like
variations you know change feet and
we've got some nice uh
that's so neat though that's great
yeah that's what my wife does too um i mean she falls asleep so we have to we have to pick just the right kind of movie t- t- t- to to appeal
that keeps plenty of exercise for you
but even that yeah if you go out you know because_1 some people go out maybe
you know in the sixties
it's really become a major expense for us as a society
well yeah because_1 we're in the the Garland Y
you can feel all the way through it's like a knife like a sw- like a sword a sword slicing in half or whatever
and so therefore when we have an enemy come against us i really feel like
"crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct"
uh they gave some figures out and since it's inception uh they've the price has gone up per stu- the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty three percent
i think they're so corrupt that they just use it as a vote getting
yeah i'm an old i'm an old guy
the Raiders huh um
huh well what brought you guys down to Texas then
and i guess that probably started me on a career because i walk a lot in fact it's a part of my life every day i
or fuel injected so there goes the carburetor and if the fuel injection system breaks down there's no way in the world you're going to work on that
yeah well that's a big thing too at our house it was we couldn't let it in the house but the thing that i think my parents used it most for was to teach us responsibility
yeah i- "i used to be a builder"
let me ask you do you think the Soviet Union is a still a threat to the United States
oh i could imagine
have you th- now that's down in uh Highland Park it's Highland Park Village did you like it
again it was an oriental person
so let's see wh- where did you you said you're in Houston
um there i mean i mean we're have to be we're alerted there's all sorts of systems where suicide
oh i've never seen that one
yeah it's it's it's a strange one it will kind of scare you if you don't know what it's doing because_1 right now is when it's dropping it's leaves
yeah they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago
and that's uh course hydrogen sulfide which is when you burn gasoline you also produce some water vapor and that goes back in with your sulphur and you under the right condition you get H2S
and you know what's bad i mean like i'm going into you know an education related field and i just you know it just
oh they that was
depending on i'm real happy with the vacation i guess you know you could take vacation days if you had to stay home but
it's supposed to die off like in August and then you re- replant it in September
yeah well at least you know that it wasn't same
and it's are you cooking the whole head at one time okay
that on the last one he said oh i never remember that answer and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers
now San Francisco i think's almost everybody's favorite
so in m- in my spare time with a two and a half and a three and a yes that's really changed my reading habits because_1 i used to read so much especially when i was in school
"you know this thing in Saudi Arabia and all and they still don't allow women to vote it is still amazing" of course we we don't have such a wonderful history that
they're eating pecans though pecans are probably not taken from Virginia they're probably only in the South
do you do you like the s- do you wear suits or do you like more more feminine type dresses
so they know that it's not a
weather beater type stuff yeah
uh there's too many too many homes on the market right now too many people are just bailing out on their homes and leaving them their abandoning abandoning their homes
hum how long do you plan to be going for
yes yes that's right that's for sure
uh yes i do full time
and it works out fine i mean i stop i'm never in a hurry to get anywhere
they're supposed to have all these laws passed where people aren't supposed to hire illegal aliens and all this and whether that's working or not i don't know because i don't hear anymore about it
um i do remember when it was over i remember when they were coming home
yeah and she was real comfortable and she has really really done good i- i
so i guess partly it depends on on how isolated the river is
you know when somebody comes in and offers i think that's one of the real problems particularly when
and i have to admit that when the weather starts to get cold there's just no fun like a busted knuckle i just uh i just can't even tell you the joy i get from that experience and
is that done o- right
if you want to go first go ahead
we had one in Virginia that was sentenced to death and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago i don't know if there was anything in your paper about it
i'm afraid they'll start uh picking out people with every possible type of risk factor and trying to exclude them from health coverage
not only in the courts is that costing us
i do have some Republican leanings because i am division one you know
yeah yeah they have they uh it does
to do that uh
you know messing with young children and i mean it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other
yeah it is tough it's a- and i don't know who's even proposing it or or how they plan on implementing it if they do
talk you can't bat an eye you can't do anything you know and uh uh i play in a group that we've been playing together now about seventeen years here
and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall
oh oh knishes no you don't y- you you don't see a lot of that that's basically Eastern European Jewish food
i'm i'm starting a side business in desk top publishing
it's not what they're doing it's not that they're doing so much wrong as that they can't not cannot do
so i mean i i don't know what to do as far as that's concerned but it is nerve racking
well tell me what what do you think of uh of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth
and so hopefully he'll eventually put something together
oh oh gee i- i- i- i did a lot of the wrong things i'm sure
they went to interview this town i mean it's a little dinky town they went to interview them_1 about the gun control laws
i don't know i would i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around
you have a nice day and i'm going to say good bye for now and if you're ever up Rhode Island way around TI look me up it's Ray Smith at TI in Albrough Massachusetts
i don't i really can't disagree with it
it for profit making for these people
well did you understand what this was for you know what it was for what we
that's true that's true i don't know
i don't think that was on ABC anyway i don't know what happened to it though
who work in the recreation field for companies like this and actually um a break like that increases productivity and and with the commensurate um
and i just quit
c- uh community service hours in their area that's
i don't know what we're going to do long range to solve the budgeting problem but there certainly has been proposals why are are you aware of the Grace Commission proposals from a few years back
yeah well i i really
yeah so he was he had a lot of medication coming in from Europe
oh so it was a completely new experience for you and i'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it
now we we were in uh my wife went into the emergency room and she wa- we were there for about_1 four hours and it came out to about_1 fifteen hundred dollars
you know it does take a long time it takes money to do that so and it's a public defender most of the time so
usually have them come from you know projects to collect old ones usually just get dumped out with the trash and phone books are a large volume of annual
well they offer classes out at uh Ray Hubbard
right at the same time they're getting them_1 you know six weeks later it's not you know not so
yeah i saw reruns of it i saw yeah tapes of yeah
and uh as hard as they try to get these
yeah at least they won't be coming after my husband you know saying hey your wife's charged so much money on this credit card we want the money
and uh m- my bird at that time was picking the feathers out from underneath his wing
yeah i've heard that's really really good uh friend of mine at work saw that
although i s- you know i'm starting to see some of their um there's there's a daily new
yeah so you have your hands full with them that's for sure
yeah i know we keep calling it the English system but i'm i'm not sure what they do in England now they're they're on metric aren't they
well good talking to you
um what do you think about the different you know the different formats the republican and democrat
do you guys like what kind of food do you like
you too bye bye
it's it's really scary it's um
we wouldn't let them_1 in yeah
if all the internal bickering between in Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health health uh over who's going to get credit for solving it were to be set aside
so i got rid of all those i mean i hated to get rid of those suits and pantsuits that were a hundred and fif-
uh we try to go once maybe twice a summer uh
yeah even when when i first moved to Dallas from New York it seemed like Dallas was so open you know everybody left their doors open you just run in the store you leave your car running
they turned all installation up here off
and someplace i'd like to go is like to the other side of the Caribbean as y- you know as opposed to the Mexican side i want drink rum drinks and uh
but your teacher had control
just have a bunch of green here and there
is that right you think they you think that's the case
but no huh do you
right i guess uh i don't know what part of New Jersey you're in but i guess it's uh fairly industrial
i have some do you
well you all don't get as much rain near Plano as we do here i'll bet
i don't think it's had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands
be a potential power problem later with um who's going to be in charge with this new world order
and um i think it would be i know that also one of my cousins who uh he is in like the therapy type thing and and he was um
and uh cranberry sauce i- i could eat just that and be satisfied
yes the new one of course
and when i drove through i was it was terrible i had to keep the windows up
but exactly what you're describing is what happens all over
but um you know if i don't know that i would go back as often if it wasn't for the idea that i have fun there
it's like you're just so used to the dog being around and stuff
oh okay well i have also but he's he'll be thirty seven in uh February
it was just beef cooked with a a lot of wine and and uh all kinds of spices the rosemary and those kind of things and it turned out really really well
and so uh overbuilding is i- it has been a real problem there
and have the services that we need and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and and things like that and i think i guess
so you actually got some kind of feel for what the faculty
because they require that
yeah yeah it's it's it's uh it's probably movable the cabinet but it would be tough to move i was able to take some of the pieces apart it's like a kitchen pantry basically
i really don't it's just when they come on and they say they need an Uzi in order to do some accurate or
now they're just doubling their stress "and tha[t's]- and" that's really
but what do you do do you
me too i'm an older person like the more toned down things
and that's what it is so go ahead and put it in there and uh
you know it just um
uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place
and every since that day i have been inundated with
just in general everything
but i i i don't know i think discipline i guess if i were to look at one thing we've lost
i think i don't know how much is it in Dallas
is it uh was she the major wage earner i mean did she earn more money that he did or do you know
yeah i would love to i mean i just love to you know stories about the kids i grew up with but uh i'd like to see i'd still like to see them_1 yeah
people just they they really don't uh there's too much labor involved i guess to separate the stuff
told them to go do it and they did it you know got in and got out i'm not sure the the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks i would think
well i guess i had to wait a long time till they found somebody
and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time that's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem
you know looking you know finding the right place uh
naw th- i guess that would be a good idea
okay so after that then you couldn't get a you couldn't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side
so you are real so all the rest of us are um immigrants
well the maybe if they're listening to thi- maybe if they when they listen to this maybe they can set that up a little better
that's what our two rooms are on the front too with these long windows one is a bedroom for our our oldest son and one is um
and uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers uh we do have
and you know how much you're going to drive every week
but when i do play
but what we ended up with was about four thousand
"and the view that i'd take" is that
everything went all right
yeah the University of Pittsburgh well i was probably a little bit too young for that but um i know we just laugh now in terms of not specific teams but um
she's real good at finding sales though you know sh- sh- she'll buy a lot of sh- yeah she'll buy a lot clothes at the end of seasons you know and uh just have them for the next year
uh-huh yeah that's what we do too
but that's Bush saying it
but now i have a child and i i read the comics every day
oh okay all right i work out in Plano too i was just wondering if it was near where i am
i think it might be inappropriate for us to say for me to say that in any in any industry
i don't no i- i haven't recently um
she said they couldn't see those things out there
and you're seeing them_1 uh get uh elected to uh political offices uh not near enough i know there's still a long way to go especially in top management
you don't get to watch it
what else is im- important uh obviously i think uh
well this guy that was sitting in in front of me said that he was a private investigator and he had been tailing the woman that was murdered
women's roles are or how they've changed
yeah yeah they you see them_1 in football on TV once in awhile but you but you never see them_1 on a
but um it was doing it quite frequently and so i had a repairman come out and look at it and he said well you need this and so done to this machine and i said oh really
um just really different ones um
you know they're the kind of people who are who've always got to have a cause whether it's good bad of indifferent they've got to have a cause and
like when say we retire after the year two thousand
credit cards is one of my wonderful topics um do you have quite a few or
yeah unless they have a coffee strike or the drug problem gets out of uh proportion like it did for awhile
um i could if i wanted to i'd i'm not right now
Dickey Thorne at uh short stop that ought to help them but their problem is other than Ryan and an occasional flash of brilliance of other people there's just nobody there
uh -kay uh do you live in a a single family dwelling as they call it
i i don't think considering i don't think it affects my job and like nobody um
okay well i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in Texas and uh
not feasible so uh yeah the government should probably step in and uh take a little more charge and what's really good is um
uh going through that day care experience because they learned so many things uh such as responsibility independence
uh-huh i think that's that's how i feel too i feel a need to dominate certain things and i try real hard not to be to too domineering with with Emily
and it i don't know probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in Texas yeah
okay you you too and uh have a good summer then down there uh-huh bye-bye
yeah you like comedies
oh yeah definitely i i'm i'm a little bit shocked to what the US has done in terms of selling to Iraq
property taxes have been going up repeatedly
because it smokes real a whole lot and that smoked flavor gets up into the meat
they wanna be -ith their frien- well how old are your kids are they married or what
right in fact when he was Governor of New Hampshire i believe okay
right right so this
um yeah because they're not as reliable as the government wants them to be
i think we're supposed to talk about magazi- magazines
well we have a funny commercial around here it says something like if people were to give "five hours a week or five percent of their salary" we could they could solve all the world's problems or something
especially in um the Dallas area you know there's there's so much money and everyone can afford they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn and
well speaking of termites we had those this
right right accessories uh-huh
that's right and i'm sorry that business
i think she paid eighteen or twenty [laughter-she's] and they tease her
pushing a MasterCard that you know they're supposed to spend so much of the money on on conservation measures and stuff
they have a flexible spending account up here where you can contribute a certain amount every month to this flexible spending pl- spending plan and use that money to uh pay your medical uh costs out of
so to speak sixties and seventies and then
well we only did that once now since we've been married we just go um we go real often to Colorado to the mountains but we'll stay in cabins
i can't remember his
but there's nothing on TV ever hardly
it uh comes on before but it's real cute well he's bouncing around and his name is Jot and then he has got a friend named Cat
do you have any thoughts on uh uh uh our jury system
i talked to one in California i never asked him the other day how he was connected i don't think he was TI employee
well luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here uh San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime
yeah at the moment i've got a Cadillac Cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a uh
if i let one of them watch pretty soon they'd all be watching
"yes yeah i think uh"
you take the gross national income
yeah right we watched them_1 down here for the Rose Bowl
but uh i guess do you have much mowing to do with yours then
in the kind of job or well i think that you probably have a full-time job if you're a college student
um i hope it happens peacefully
do you back up to it on the south side or the east side
but uh i don't know i th- for a rather small town well hundred thousand people or so i guess this pretty progressive community
i really think it's true for our family and i think it has worked very well
Carly Simon or whatever that's probably what i would stick to
well i i i enjoy working out when i i get home from work just to just to have something to do that that i know isn't going to that's that's good for me something to do other than
so they finally just said uh if we catch you we're going to take away your license and take away your boat if we have to
they should've just let him loose in the city would have just cleaned house i think he would have done better
i'm not familiar with that
sounds like a good idea
yeah um weather we pay too much or uh maybe we got back what we
okay so uh during the summertime do you dress differently than than you would when school's going on
most most of the time now they do the first week after the first six months so that "if somebody really needs that time"
yeah The World According to Garp he wasn't always funny in that show was he
well the way things go i think i'm going to have to work till i'm seventy five whether i quit and uh uh or when i retire get a part-time job
you know or totally restrictive
he you know i hate you know hate to admit this but we live on
i guess that that uh it's it's the way people perceive and they perceive from their own wants too sometimes
we go my family once a year goes up to the in the mountains around here it's to a place called Cup River and
this this craziness you know people with uh automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job and let's face it what do they get paid
and it was a terrible a terrible situation
so we can't take our any of our sales taxes or anything off anymore because of the reform
th- the big Republican thing is that they don't they vote for less government they want less government involvement in society and so they're more less apt to vote in you know more aid to people or more
"for instance uh i saw a thing on uh Nova think was the other day this guy has designed"
but uh how are your your flowers your little things you planted did they die or what
yeah go have lunch with them_1 and stuff like that but that sounds pretty cool
unless it's there's some trend or or something that says gee this this neighborhood has been hit forty seven times or whatever uh that's that's sort of more of a of a pattern news
i- i- i really think we're going to far overboard with all of this
well we used to have um Ralph Dutchen but now he's in Massachusetts he's come back a couple of times then there's a trumpet player at North Texas the the teacher the main teacher
that too and it is hard to make uh those interests not be as a major part of my life
yeah i definitely want to see that have you seen uh The Doors
but uh that's where a family relationship is really built and uh it's uh then they have
um it seems that there's such an effort to make it work there that what they really do need is is the loans and the
and how to do market stuff but in about
i don't know if there's enough money that you could pay them just you know
"you know i look at my daughter and she's now uh" four going to be four and i keep saying oh jeez i don't have that much time with her
um that's the thing about it is you can switch it depending on the circumstance
okay uh well since i initiated the call i guess i'll start off first uh number one i have absolutely no problem with random testing
right which is ridiculous
i dare sent order any of that stuff because then
well and probably too even those who might initially be opposed once they got into it then they you know would see that hey this
i start with maybe if if does do you know if the population favors statehood or
do i could always do the alternator you know and starter i don't anymore but i have on a lo- a lot of times
well they went over it in the trial but they didn't give the stuff to the jury afterward it was really bizarre uh
exactly it's kind i find it kind of sad i really do
yeah we see them once in a while a couple of times a year at least and the ones in Pittsburgh of course we see more often
oh i think some things are clothing definitely
yeah well uh um Jeopardy comes on right after Wheel of Fortune Monday through Friday here in Miami
well have you ever been a victim of any p- any type of crime
a nice enough house to find something to steal
well that's what i meant when i said the school
yeah we uh we've got you know i'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there
have you only done that once or you've done that several times
but we have all single families so many single families now um
uh one's twenty six and the other is uh twenty twenty one
a lawyer with amnesia who was in it
so uh took it up there
no not yet i guess i've been con- kind of considering it have you seen it yet
now that we've done our conversation for tonight
so tha[t's]- that's interesting to me
i guess there seems like their some programs that are more valuable
oh i'm glad my husband's not like that either i'd kill him my brother's like that and um
well they did have a fairly decent year finally this year
well i guess that was good that you were you were hearing it from other students
well preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime
yes it and it's funny because_1 the one i have every single month without fail she has babies
thanks have a good day
we are we have accepted people other people from other countries so well to the point that we have not taken care of our own how do you feel about
well how how cold has it been
yeah well it was a political move it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern
turned around and called them junkyards and started making profits off them after the war
yeah and uh that's right Aikman did go to OU i forgot about that
and so when i got this color test done for clothing i found out that that's probably the worst color i can wear
to brighten up your life oh it's just amazing um but he can't say anything he can just kind of make noises you know
exactly yeah i'd i uh
um-hum hm uh yeah well
which would include onion and cheese and again more dill weed and some medium hot peppers as you can see i'm inclined towards the of a meal
have you ever been there
uh that was the topic of yesterday's T I conversation and and uh i think it's really interesting because i think all of those things wind up carrying the message and i think uh um
"yeah don't blame her"
oh i oh i know it
yeah i think i mean that's pretty i- that's a pretty important uh
you know now the question is would you again go buy that same brand would you recommend that brand
and uh let's see we've uh just recently discovered a super restaurant down here but it's uh
well great that sounds good
so i think that'll be coming
do you live in a high crime area
how's uh well no we're not supposed to talk about that we're supposed to talk about current events well i'm a current event junkie so i
uh i guess i basically consi- consider [mykelf/myself] kind of conservative uh Republican how about_1 you
ever- every time they go one way the wind is always blowing the other which is
well i bet you have
i i don't know how many
yeah uh-huh maybe once every three months or something like that but
to do uh spreadsheet analysis for various uh businesses that we're studying and also uh you know it hooks up to normal printers and what have you and uh works pretty well in that mode as well
and then one time i had a tooth capped you know one of my caps f- fell off and uh
so sometimes uh especially traveling with TI you know everything goes on American Express
if you are not a member of a group
oh i didn't know that well i learned something already
well i appreciate talking to you good luck in your car buying
the Rangers all right
that's a real good um he talks about that talks about
however they could not tell the ju- the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal
she'll let something slip and we'll say wait a minute and and that's it she just well i didn't want to bother you she can't accept that we want to be the care givers
well it seems like i don't have time for them but i'm i don't work full-time or anything
well they have it every year
they've always been you know my favorite
okay so i'm in Richardson so when i heard the topic i was thinking of the thing down at um Maceo High School in Dallas
you you i know you really don't have a choice
maybe a program like that could replace some of the uh welfare programs
have you ever uh organized a family reunion
you know th- the the air systems are reasonably calm you don't have uh the turbulence you know you little bit of chop but it's not like it is in the spring time
yeah but you need to continue to read so you you can people learn to read know
you know if you go to um uh a fight and then
oh he's really not that uh country i mean i've heard him sing stuff that really doesn't sound too you know
Duke'll be mighty mad though
oh i probably spend an hour or two
if that if if that amounts for anything
payroll hassle and everything
yes but we dream
she does all of the flower gardening throughout the whole property and we shou- have
so they it was planned
and uh my garage was just getting overwhelmed and of course i didn't go weekly so it became quite a big thing and uh
yeah something about uh returning goods and uh if they're getting any better than they used to be
i right and and so that but i was working full-time uh when he was born but i was very lucky because i was a a college professor
i wish i had a boat but i don't
i embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial all we all i do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are
so a lot of things that they're saying that they're no longer gonna be doing for
a small camper we've we've traveled in a big one i hate them because they're hard to jockey around you know but maybe a pickup with the back on
but the corruption at the top i think limits that
delivery room and everything include including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay but that was that was still included in that pr- "that cost so" it's really nice because they
how other cultures and other other countries live so i- i definitely agree that it's it's good i just you know i- i- i
report or uh uh
really i wasn't sure because uh just generally you know that kind of scary stuff i- i just don't want to have anything to do with it
i guess if i was having a dinner party i depending on the number of people i might cook a like a brisket or a roast or a maybe a chicken dish
yeah we rented one from uh Cruise America
it's hard to do that when you're not there constantly
it's finally cleared up it's just now st- still a little overcast but the s- but the sun has finally started popping out
"well they vary tremendously"
it's it's a major undertaking i mean people have to give up their work and and a lot of their time
that isn't so they they're they're they're two horses of of three different colors and i had an experience uh i had to i stayed in the dormitory
it almost goes by case by case
"it's worse the service is worse" it really is than buying new because um people just don't know how to fix things now and yeah
ye- i never thought of that that'd probably work
which i instead of making out of redwood which is really dear on the east coast
then you can find out from you know you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about the-
i sai- i said i'm supposed to
well what kind of music do you not like
or decreasing in quality
well you know we we i live in a uh in a city that's uh twenty five about_1 twenty five thousand and it's in the northeast and we really don't have a
a real like strict dress code as far as you know suits and everything i can wear pretty much what i want as long as it's decent
that's not too bad that's north
right right well picking up Darrell Strawberry didn't hurt
which is another one that has nice pictures in it
but as long as you've got career politicians that spend twenty five to forty five years in Washington
of government agencies and companies be tested especially when it effects public safety i mean the military obviously uh people that run trains and airplanes and and the like
and and of course when it's a small corporation it also wants to expand so that money's spent
um when you can carry it you can just take it to a range and back home again if you want to hunt you need a special hunting license
we uh put in a a storage room out in the in the back part of our hall here we took took part of the garage and turned it into inside of the house
yeah i think it's an interesting field and
and it was it was really wild because uh
well we have attempted to reforest some areas but as a matter of fact at one time this was uh a very dense forest in this area and
it was a Braun and they were real good about taking it back it wasn't a problem at all so uh i was able to get that back pretty easily
and uh that's great i mean i every since i put that thing in my car i haven't heard a tape since
pro capital punishment except that i don't like the way it's done
oh okay so you wouldn't know him he
we're just we're just housing them until they die
you know kind of uh rolls that they have here it was a harder crust and some of the hoagies were cooked like the Philadelphia um steak
you know he was an an assistant district attorney in Chicago at uh and while he was writing the book and uh
uh advertised in videos like that and i've heard some athletic clubs have
sure i enjoyed talking to you Fred
i know it i've
and this year um moved into a to a
and i like i like rap music do you like rap music
in fact in the eight years i've been here it seems to me it gets more and more gets to be more and more restrictive place to live
that's we bought one like that
uh i do walking on the treadmill and then i do low impact aerobics
corporation uh type programs like payroll and uh financial data bases and we also have uh
yeah i might as well uh one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh
well that would that did a lot of good i'm sure
yeah yeah program related research related i've
we take the rent first
now that'll be nice
so it's now he has the pressure too of being super dad and super career and
she was able to get better and come home she really missed the association with the people there
you feel they get a better education
two or three novels a week
yeah oh gee i guess we can't win
well my husband wouldn't do that anyway
um i don't know how cost efficient that would be i guess
so so where do you go do you go to Berkeley
how mu- how much does that cost you
and uh then we were set up in about five minutes ten minutes
oh capital punishment yeah uh
and there's there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city but there isn't any um
but really uh wh- what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing
we have to just report what's happening we can't say well this is what i think about you know the situation sometimes
people gotten laid off lately you know from companies like General Dynamics of and Texas
uh can you remember driving down the highway i could as a kid you know you just get rid of it you roll the window down and you throw but you wouldn't
i never get in in time for any of those so
yeah yeah but i'm not gonna put a skirt on
well that's hard work
i'm kind of like you i've never really gotten into it it's just a it's just a chore you know and i finally decided one semester i'm in college and i'm taking night classes and
yeah co-payments type stuff
uh-huh uh-huh how's that i haven't seen that
to the top the of the peak sure
you know if they're on some kind of
yeah about that woman
because goi- going to make
and and there's there's no problem with
and uh course uh all the people that follow the Lakers and everything out there in in California um and it also helps when they were winning
you know they just don't have the money or just uh feel that there isn't a need for it
"and yeah and uh i'll i talked to a thirteen year old last night who's uh goes to uh"
but uh while i was i i've worked for Texas Instruments out in Ridgecrest California for eight years and one time we went down to uh Bakersfield
that's that's true yeah
that they uh it's i think the comparison is like baseball managers this year they seem to uh say two weeks in uh you've had your chance time to uh
i mean now i-
how to replace that one piece without having to tear it all down because it's one of the inset pieces so there's a lot of things to you know to look for and um
you know it i- it's always backlogged it usually takes a guy usually a guy sits on death row for three or four years at least before they put him you know in the ac- actual electric chair
uh-huh uh-huh i uh was talking to a fellow today and he seemed to think it was going to make a difference but i said hey if a lot of people are all ready borrowed up
is uh i- i think they do a lot there was one thing that that uh that helped pull my mom out of uh this
they've really been at the wrong time for me they seem to start very late for us and i got to be at work you know i'm leaving the house at like seven fifteen and so uh uh
uh those people with more money
and everybody feels that way at times at
maybe we'll see you in the restaurants somewhere okay uh-huh b- bye-bye
and the sun's bouncing off the roof to start with and so ye- it's even hotter and
but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up
oh that is hard
oh think it's a eighty nine
nothing like the guns and the and the and the violence there is in the school with kids
they make them they like i don't know how to explain it they make them hard you know
well i don't know i
yeah that's that's my opinion is that some of these high powered handguns need to go out the window because_1 they're obviously not for hunting
yeah an- the one in Mesquite is um Scyene exit
but in my neighborhood they have had voluntary recycling for several years now
Santa Fe type dishes and uh
uh in fact i am kind of disappointed in American made things uh
yeah they don't mention that part yeah that's exactly right there was a thing on the other night about they had this women uh her husband was a police officer and was killed
and he turned around and left
so it's not very crowded and it's real inexpensive and it's brand new so it's it's a really nice place to go
i do sit on very low chairs to read stories to kindergartners and
it whe- when we administer it
yeah it makes you wonder um had the jury been a different group of people
Eureka's Castle it's called it's just like a Sesame Street show but
uh pork barrel politics the- the- there has to be some way to do it i know state governors usually have line item vetos and uh
yeah really then you'll have to say see in my age i didn't have to do it oh really dad yeah oh well okay
well any other anything else that we want to talk about on budgeting
i have a crepe myrtle tree in the backyard that still hasn't done anything and i'm kind of wondering what kind of shape it's in right now
it was of a lady and she was kneeling and it was about
just different things that you buy and and what the latest items are out and stuff it it's real informative
okay let's see um
tuition and try to make things monthly so that there are as few surprises as possible but i do[n't]- i've started keeping a budget on computer
and they can really be out or eligible for parole in a fairly short space of time
i guess i'm uh i you know i'm satisfied i mean i uh
yeah yeah absolutely yeah we uh we stocked up the first time around but we've definitely got all the formulas on file and uh
does the medical care in nursing homes is typically less than
uh i started out in in high school expecting to go into engineering
are do you work outside the home
split it up a little bit
that's about the only snow we can get down here in Texas if it if it were a white paint you probably used a a uh redwood color or a stain didn't you
i guess i'm more conservative in my viewpoints i mean i think it's great if they want it if you know women wanna do that and i'm planning on being a nurse so but
of um you know that
i agree with you there
for retirement you know
wow what do you do
uh drive by shootings in high schools are you know
oh extremely yeah i was one of those kids that would go into a menu go into a restaurant when i was a kid and and and would not order unless i had never had it before
she does shed a lot of fur
whenever i uh i have a problem in that i don't make the time and i i understand the importance of it and in fact when i was in high school and college i was
well i i guess it's pretty good and and like the Dallas area and i ge- i
no no but uh when i- it had gone up
but the last problem i had with my vehicle was a uh fuel pump "that needed replacing"
low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families
okay this sounds kind of like slightly jumbled situation there
and the people that he got the Akita from used to have cats and they no longer have any other cats
oh yeah ours is nineteen years old
and then i come in and help her
i been sitting in here uh in the house all weekend with a cold so i thought i'd better uh better get outside and do something and not waste the day
but i- i try to try to live within a budget you know and so
it's pretty sad a lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read you know
i haven't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis somebody will say oh did you hear about this that happened last week and it might be local and it might be national and i'm
it mea- it means i've always got my foot in the gas an- and and the other one in the in the clutch so i i burn up the clutch a lot
you know uh um i read a book one time or a m- a magazine article and they said something about how
we have different communities
oh you fish upstream
i don't know disco was pretty much dead by then so so that's what i mean disco wasn't really my time
yes you do um now do you have a lot of mountain well you don't have mountains in Texas do you where do you find places to camp
you know it really kills me you know i mean it's it it really is a shame that you know you know United States somehow we spend more money on each student
well i think that's i think that's great that she does that i i'll applaud that um
oh see and i just don't i don't dare try all that stuff because i don't even know if i like it to if i don't like it it doesn't get made around here
well that's all right he uh you're worth it you're worth every penny of it
they do seem to have a very much improved uh intellectual sort of a spirit they're bright they look around and and they they know what's going that's that i guess that's as important to say
you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them and i don't think that would really warrant capital punishment
oh i heard they just canceled that i read in today's paper they just canceled that show
every month my husband uh goes to the credit union and withdraws you know X amount of dollars for the month and then that money is used during that month we have a certain budget
this is not our subject i guess but uh
the economy is is doing badly and Bush isn't looking good as a result
but without something like death or impeachment
yeah they make uh
"my parents in New York had uh"
some examples are this uh some of the things like Jimmy Carter's been involved in uh a little program to you know fix up housing for people
but um some friends of mine have um gone through this i think i'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention
yeah i always said if i die- well i always said if i died i'd come back as a dog that'd be the best way to be
i believe there was one case i don't i don't know where i read it or anything but i think there there has to they have to have put innocent men "or women to death before i mean"
i love those movies
"and so i you know am " probably being very naive [laughter-i'm] that that by by centralizing it it might get better and be cheaper
um i think my favorite show is Hunter "and i i like the old ser-" series better when um
education of the people is primary i would think
is that is that your dog calling you to go running again
a- as long as you're sort of safely removed from it it seems seems not so not so bad i guess but
uh some more uh beautiful parts of the country uh i think that that uh we become a little more aware uh rather quickly of
also um another thing that that i noticed that was very strange i was uh i would go down all these uh
well and i just carry the absolute minimum required by law
but that's the only one but he'd get more if he could
and uh well i guess first time i went there is about eight years ago i'd i'd just moved back from Florida and went over there you know with my parents
but uh yeah i would like to see them uh
oh yeah and help help with the housework a little bit
while back you have it's been a long time since that was the case
would it would really be nice to make it a little harder to get one so that every punk in the world doesn't doesn't pack a rod
did you yeah i- it it really is it's such a classic yeah
i [laughter-can't] imagine that yeah
he knows you know he's
a fairly small amount of that if you look at a percentage basis and i think that there are so many other areas that we are
also i was going to just mention that i wear what you know my my w- my wardrobe how should i say it i wear what i can fit into
yeah but at least they would at least that way they would be helping pay for their own
do you um have a family budget or how do you work your budgeting
no i don't even wear white stockings with this just because it's just too much white with the white shoes and everything
wh- and even within women
i- i guess you work for TI yeah
obsessive person and when i start something i- i go into it a thousand percent
uh-huh well that's yeah that's what they say i've heard them_1 say that's it's just kind of like coloring or paint by number
about how many miles is that
