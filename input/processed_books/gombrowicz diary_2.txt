290Volume 2draw your attention, dear critics, to all the places in my art where the Inferior, theYounger, creates the Superior in its own way, because there you have the mostintense poetry I can create.But let us also not forget that man does not like maturity because he prefershis youth. That is why Ferdydurke also contains both of these strivings—it is as Ihave already indicated in this diary, ‘‘the image of the battle for one’s own maturityby someone enamored of his own immaturity.’’ Here, therefore, the formula be-comes degrading once again.And, ﬁnally, will a man who is always beneath value, always compromised(insofar as to be a man means to be ‘‘worse,’’ worse than that which he produces),not seek an outlet for his inner life in the appropriate realm, in trash? BrunoSchulz grasped this in his study of Ferdydurke, published in the prewar literarymonthly Skamander. He calls it ‘‘the sphere of subcultural, undereducated andrudimentary contents,’’ where human immaturity ﬁnds release. ‘‘Our immaturity’’—he continues—‘‘(and perhaps at bottom our vitality) is tied in a thousand knots,braided with a thousand atavisms to a second-rate suit of forms, to a second-classculture. While under the cover of ofﬁcial forms we honor higher, sublimatedvalues, our real life plays itself out secretly and without higher sanctions in thatdirty realm, and the emotional energies located in it are a hundred times morepowerful than those the thin layer of ofﬁcialdom dispenses.’’I will add: he who does not extract and does not feel this ‘‘degradation’’ inFerdydurke, in The Marriage, and in my other works, has not grasped my mostimportant point.

They conceive of my work as just one more struggle with society, a critiqueof society. Let us see if my man does not explode this concept.These, in brief, are his characteristics:
(1) Man created by form, in the profoundest, most universal sense.(2) Man as the creator, the indefatigable producer of form.(3) Man degraded by form (always being an ‘‘under-’’ or an ‘‘im-’’—under-educated, immature).(4) Man in love with immaturity.(5) Man created by Inferiority and Youngerness.1957291(6) Man subject to the ‘‘interhuman’’ as a superior, creative force, our onlyaccessible divinity.(7) Man ‘‘for’’ man, knowing no higher instance.(8) Man animated, elevated, magniﬁed by other people.
These features of my man are the ones that occur to me right now. Do youwant to reduce all of this to one single revolt against the social forms of being?

Occasionally they have rather strange grievances. They demand—or atleast some of them do—that I ‘‘solve’’ this world—that I take care of its tragiccontradictions, change it into a ‘‘constructive’’ little world. This is a bit childish. Imost certainly will not untie the Gordian knots of life. My morality? It depends,ﬁrst of all, on my expressing protest in the name of my humanity—on the irony andsarcasm that express my rebellion. Second, it depends on the belief that everythingthat helps us decipher our true nature and predicament in the world is our triumphover nature.In my opinion, only a literature that cannot be taken seriously attempts tosolve the problems of existence. Serious literature poses them. One man will notsolve the problems of existence—they solve themselves, if they solve themselves atall, in humanity.Serious literature does not exist to make life easy but to complicate it.

I must combat the pettiness of the reader. His is a pusillanimous reading ofmy texts. It seems that they are afraid of getting the entire meaning, not because itwould terrify them but only because they are not accustomed to a completecontents. They try violently to change me into one more specimen of a conven-tional literature, yet they themselves claim that my writing deﬁes all conventions.I don’t say this about all the reviews that have appeared. It does happen thata critic will allow himself a little boldness and panache now and then only to followthem with an immediate and hurried withdrawal into the land of platitudes.Trans-Atlantic? What will happen to Trans-Atlantic, which should be ap-pearing in Poland any day now? Everything I write is equally basic and universal.Try as I might, I cannot reduce my subject, which will always be man and the292Volume 2world. But Trans-Atlantic also concerns Poland, and that little word ‘‘Poland’’ is allit takes to have all the local complexes echo in response.

Sometimes, when reading these articles, I forget that I am, after all, anartist. I begin to believe that I am the author of a multivolumed philosophicalwork. . . . There is constant talk about my ‘‘concepts,’’ almost never about my art.No, I would not accuse most of my commentators of a lack of intelligence.After having read Janusz Kowalewski’s silly article about the Diary in the émigrépress, I realized that this level of discussion would be impossible in Poland. Andwhen I compare these critiques of Ferdydurke with those from before the war, I seethat the atmosphere . . . of the times . . . is quite different. I reproach them, as I havesaid, for their timidity, for their conceptual narrowness, which, however, is under-standable considering that they write more for the masses than the aristocraticcritics of the West do. Still, I note a ﬂaw in the very function, attitude, andarrangement of this criticism. Columns full of diligent analyses that can be neitherexhaustive nor clarifying because they are too short, columns that must weary thereader because they are too long . . . what purpose do they serve? Who needs them?And so devoid of artistry! The dreariness of Polish life pulsates from this forced,tiring, straightforward thinking that wants to understand, to realize, to explain toothers but does not know how to thrill—it lacks imaginativeness, Schwung, charm,radiance, poetry, playfulness. This criticism is like a ﬁnger put to a quiveringstring—it kills the vibrations. There is something wrong in their approach to art—and in the long run it can have a negative inﬂuence on the artistic temperament ofthe nation.This is probably tied to the Polish ‘‘beauty crisis.’’On the whole the criticism is very much comme il faut, it has very goodmanners—how much more unpretentious and sensible, less aggressive and uncere-monious than before. . . . With the exception of Mr. Kisiel in Tygodnik Powszechny.That he refers to me as that ‘‘guy’’ and can’t even get the title of my novel Trans-Atlantic right does not bother me, but everything in that little piece is shallow, non-sensical, swimming in a soup concocted of nonchalance, a dismal journalisticarrogance that endows columnists with some sort of euphoria when it comes to1957293babbling just any old thing. He proclaims that Ferdydurke and my Diary are‘‘nothing more than endless variations on the topic ‘Poland and I.’ ’’ And he re-proaches me with having ‘‘messianic and polonocentric illusions.’’ I have readmany untruths about myself, but something so utterly wrong from A to Z, neitherhere nor there, so ‘‘concretely invented’’ as my Argentine friends from the groupConcreto Invencion say . . . ha, Mr. Kisiel, I cannot reciprocate other than bypinning to your chest, my dearest buddy, the Order of the Fellowship of Jokers andBlahblahblah.

In the dining car it is ﬁve in the afternoon, we are approaching Tandil,which is reminiscent of Salzburg from here—the slender tower of the church risingfrom the hills. Streams of spring light pour into space, the sun trembles in the air,color after color rises from the meadows until the last dispersion in the peripheriesof the heavens. Lost in dreams. It is warm. . . . The train stops in a ﬁeld. I see beforeme, through the window, grass, rails, a scrap of paper.Exhausting! I have seen it all a thousand times before. A thousand timesthe train has stopped and I have seen: the rails, a scrap of paper. The entirelandscape summed itself up: rails, scrap of paper. Riveted to the paper, I don’t takemy eyes from it, I wait until the train moves and the paper moves—left behind. Ihave done this a thousand times before. I, paper, and rails. Rails, I, and the paper.The paper, rails, and I.

Sandauer is defending himself in Poland—he is under siege. . . . I watchthis from America. I am taken aback because Adolf Rudnicki and I were once closefriends—we made our debut together and that united us. On the other hand, thereis the distance, the chilling distance of years and kilometers. I watch Poland as ifthrough a telescope and can see only the most general contours of their existence,and this invites ruthlessness.From this distance only what is not petty remains. Why then has this lo-cal hullabaloo over Sandauer’s running Rudnicki into the ground in a way that294Volume 2seemed too cruel to Rudnicki’s admirers—why has this literary tempest reached meacross the Atlantic undiminished, while their most successful books remain barelyperceptible? I have just read Sandauer’s reply, ‘‘Three Times . . . No!’’ in ˙Zycie Literackie. I will not enter into the speciﬁcs of the dispute, I don’t know how rightSandauer is in regard to Rudnicki, completely, somewhat, or not at all, but the toneof the reply thrilled me—a tone that I have not encountered thus far in the literarypress, a tone that is categorical. Is it possible that a real dialogue about art is ﬁnallytaking place in Poland? This wonderful article is like breaking open a window in aroom that has not been aired for years. It is a ﬁst striking at a ﬁction. At a conven-tional literature. At a conventional life.This I like! Indeed I believe that the chief goal of Polish postwar existenceis getting at reality. For many years they have lived in a perfectly artiﬁcial system,locked in it as if it were a glass ball. Yet the weakening of the system is certainly notsynonymous with a return of a genuine play of powers and values—for, after all(Sandauer is right here), a certain arrangement has survived from that time, anarrangement made between people and groups interested only in hanging ontotheir present positions, and this ‘‘mutual courtesy’’ perpetuates paralysis and mysti-ﬁcation. Were pride and self-interest the only things keeping this arrangementintact? What about goodness? What about decency? Various feelings and sympa-thies? Just so as not to hurt anyone? Who knows if softness is not what lends anarrangement the toughness and resistance of a wall, the weight of a cliff.That is why criticism, devastating criticism, is essential. With the aim ofsmashing the arrangement, jolting people out of their places and forcing them tobecome what they really are. Sandauer is a critic who has a profound understand-ing of the unprecedented, vital, and crucial role of the critic in this ‘‘new start’’ ofPolish literary life. He has grasped its purifying and invigorating potential.To be a pale moon shining with borrowed light, to be second-rate, conven-tional, vapid, cheaply provincial and inﬂated—or to sail out onto the broadestwaters in fearless confrontation with the world, to earn the right to the fullestexistence possible? This is the dilemma of Polish art, barely wheezing after its lastserious illness and handicapped by its tradition of nonconsummation. . . . For me,from my vantage point in the West, the matter is as clear as day. Nothing stupidercould happen to us than to continue to nurture a timidity that does not allow us tobare ourselves. Poland and Poles must be stripped bare—at least in art. Sandauer1957295was accused of speaking about Polish writing with an excessive openness and hon-esty in Paris. How do you want a decent man to speak to the world? Dishonestly?

As a supplement to the polemic with critics:First.—Let them get rid of the notion that I am an enemy of ‘‘interhuman-ity’’ (forms that become established between people). I have to rebel because thisdeforms me—but I know that this is unavoidable. This is how it should be.For example. The fact that, according to me, ‘‘people mutually force them-selves to admire art’’ (although no one is so directly enchanted by it) certainly doesnot undermine the value of art. Except that it works differently than we suppose.Second.—There exist two orders: the human and the inhuman. The worldis an absurdity and a monstrosity to our indestructible need for meaning, justice,love. A simple thought. A sure one . . .Don’t make a cheap demon out of me. I will be on the side of human order(and even on God’s side even though I am not a believer) to the end of my days andin dying as well.

The history of my becoming is the history of my constant adjustment to myliterary works—which always surprised me by being born in an unpredictable way,as if not of me. . . . To a certain degree my books are a result of my life— but my lifewas formed in greater measure from them and with them. How was it with Trans-Atlantic? Once when returning from Caballito at night, I began to amuse myself bycomposing reminiscences from my ﬁrst days in Buenos Aires on the model of somesort of Grand Guignol, and, at the same time, by dint of the past, I felt anachronis-tic, draped in an antique style, entangled in some sort of almost ancient scleroti-cism—and this cheered me up so much that I immediately commenced writingsomething that was to have been an antiquated memoir from that time. Howunsettling is that opening phase, when one has to extract the ﬁrst shape of a work,296Volume 2so awkward and unenriched by all the small inspirations that the pen encountersonly much later. Only obstinance allows one to tear through that repulsive fog-ridden beginning. But naturally—and as always—the commenced work began toslip away from me and began writing itself: what I had conceived as a chronicle ofmy ﬁrst undertakings after landing had transformed itself somehow—God knowshow, probably by way of those thousands of submissions made to form—into astrange novel about Poles, with a ‘‘puto,’’ a duel, and even a sleigh chase. . . . After alittle more than a year, I noticed that I was the author of Trans-Atlantic. But whatwas this Trans-Atlantic? A queer and whimsical thing drawn out of thin air, wovenof tens of thousands of excitements, a fantastic work. Poland? Poland had slidunder my crazy quill accidentally, only because I was writing about Poles—andperhaps because I thought of it as an anachronism; it lent itself to my little theater,to that old-fashioned scenery.Yes. But now the work is supposed to go among people—Polish people—and the Polish reader will begin to pound, as on a drum, on the ﬂimsy, imaginedtransatlantic Polishness—until it emits the rumbling sound of the war drum.Here is an account of the course of events.I am on the lookout for some sort of publisher; after all, I have to dosomething with this text. Somehow I get the address of Pawe™ Zdziechowski inParis. Through him the contact with Giedroy´ c. Fragments of Trans-Atlantic aresupposed to appear in Kultura. (I don’t take this much to heart, I am still on theperipheries of the emigration, practically a foreigner.)But letters arrive from writers I know and to whom I have sent the type-script. ‘‘God Almighty, do you realize what you have written?!’’ Or: ‘‘This wholething is impossible for ‘fellow Poles in exile’ to bear. Too cruel. Such things mustbe written if one can, but—unfortunately—publishing them must be put off untillater, when the models have died, the scenery has fallen down, and the times havechanged. . . . Of course one doesn’t have to put if off, but then woe! Woe to theauthor!’’What’s this? So—I began to understand—there’s going to be a scandal. Justas Ferdydurke in its time. Even more dangerous because I am lost in the world,alone, without support. I ask Wittlin to be the midwife for this difﬁcult birth.I write an introduction to the fragments that Kultura is supposed to print: ‘‘Iassume that the book you have in your hands will seem quite jarring—as if some lay1957297or even heretical spirit had torn into your piety. . . .’’ The preface is in some ways anew provocation because I do not intend to win anyone’s indulgence—I want topay for disregard with disregard, of which I have known plenty from my country-men and which constantly threatens me. Yet at the same time, I attempt to relievethe tension by explaining my blasphemous sneering—which not only accentuatesthe Polish problem in Trans-Atlantic, but forces me even further into seriousness.The fragments appear in Kultura. Immediately afterward Wittlin pours theclear oil of his prose onto the raging waters. An eloquent, courageous, and calmarticle, worth its weight in gold to me (but again, in defending the work, he has toextract and ﬁll in the contours of the Polish problem and so other aspects of thework grow pale).Polemics. W. A. Zbyszewski pricks me in Wiadomo´ sci with his journalist’spen, in his way, that is, affecting impudence and utter shallowness. Should I reply?While editing a short reply to Zbyszewski’s two bits, my thesis formulates itselfclearly for the ﬁrst time: to overcome our current Polishness. The thesis drops intoa vacuum. No one even twitches. Only Mieroszewski, alert as always, comments inKultura: ‘‘Crazy thoughts stalk the minds of our contemporary Polish writers.These are extraordinary views.’’I reply to Straszewicz. Here for the ﬁrst time I ﬁnd a certain tone—ofsovereign individualism—that I will continue to deploy. Remember that at thattime my voice was not yet tempered for such polemics and articles. I used only an‘‘artistic’’ style, borrowed from my books.Trans-Atlantic appears in book form, with Wittlin’s preface and my own.Outrage. Letters. Reactions pro and con. Now my role is clearly delineated. Mysecond entry into my native literature in twelve years takes place under the sign ofrebellion against the homeland.

I outline this chronology because from it one can see how the nation—letus assume that the emigration is a nation—shapes the work and a writer for itself. Awriter and a work are something changing and elusive—only the reader preservesthem in some sort of deﬁnite and commanding sense. In setting out to constructmy rickety transatlantic I had no clue that I would sail it to the shores of myhomeland as a mutineer and pirate. And if my raving, almost somnolent blas-298Volume 2phemies had not been extracted and waved about, they would not have becomemy ﬂag and I would not have discovered that my ship was a war frigate, whoseassignment was to ﬁght for a new Poland. I—that is, who? I—a child. For thecaptain of the ship was neither a responsible thinker nor an exquisite politician;merely a child who noticed, somewhat unsettlingly, that he was riding into serious-ness on a thing begun in jest.But now this tempest in a teacup forced me to ﬁnd objective and seriousreasons, to secure myself in seriousness—and then slowly I realized that I was inpossession of a dynamic idea, capable of transforming our national sense of self andgiving it new vigor. The idea was certainly nothing that could épater the modernintellectual—especially after Hegel—and was no discovery of America; it was arather natural consequence of our thinking today, which turns with such passiontoward movement and becoming, casting off the static, deﬁned world. But as aninstrument to plow through the Polish consciousness of the homeland, radicallyrefreshing our spirit, at a crucial juncture, one of those creative antitheses ofdevelopment, a new point of departure . . . yes, this could be exploited! No, no,nothing new, even for the least enlightened of Poles—this thought had rattledaround in many minds, every second it let one know it was there like a pike in apond, one could discover it in many innuendos—but to make it a rallying cry, goal,and program? Elevate it to the rank of chief thought about the nation?What was the point? This is how I saw it. I walk up to a Pole and say tohim:—You have spent your whole life falling to your knees before It. Now trysomething just the opposite. Rise up. Think not just that you must serve It—butthat It is also supposed to serve you, your development. Therefore get rid of theexcessive love and honor that shackle you, try to liberate yourself from the nation.To which that Pole would answer furiously:—You’ve gone crazy! What would I beworth if I did that? To which I say:—You must (because today it is unavoidable)decide what is the highest value to you: Poland or yourself. We must ﬁnally knowwhat your ultimate reason for being is. Choose what is more basic to you: being aman in the world or a Pole? If you give ﬁrst place to your humanity, you mustrecognize that Poland can be useful only insofar as it works in favor of yourhumanity—but if it hinders or deforms you, it must be overcome. Decide then! Buthe would answer passionately:—Not true, and you will not deceive me with yoursophistry, for I, being a Pole, can attain humanity only in my nation. Can a dog be1957299only an animal? No, a dog is an animal, but as a dog, a concrete dog, a bulldog orpointer. And a goose? A horse? Don’t take away my concreteness, for it is my life. Ithen say, taking him by the arm:—Are you deluding yourself into believing that youcan attain the concrete, that is, reality, by not expressing all your feelings? Admit,that It limits, inhibits you. . . . He:—Silence! I can’t listen to this! But I:—You wantto exist genuinely yet you are afraid of your own thoughts? . . .The eternal dialogue, the classic invitation to revolt . . . Perhaps I wouldhave undertaken this denationalizing reluctantly. . . . Why, I have already said: I amnot an admirer of cosmopolitanism—neither the scientiﬁc, dry, theoretical, andabstract cosmopolitanism with its cerebral schema of ideally universal systems—nor that which is born, in murky heads, of a sentimental anarchy, of a mawkishdream of ‘‘freedom.’’ I have trusted neither one nor the other. On the contrary, myperception of man as a being creating himself in connection with other, concretepeople pushed me in the direction of all kinds of closely bound associations. Yetthe point is that now, in this phase of my dialectics, I did not feel at all that I wasstriking at Polishness; on the contrary, I had the impression that I was rousing andenlivening it. How could that be? After all, didn’t I want to liberate them from theirPolishness? Yes, indeed . . . but this challenge really had a strange feature, thanks towhich a Pole became more of a Pole the less he was devoted to Poland. Sophistry?Let us try to be more precise.A Pole is a Pole by nature. Whereby the more a Pole is himself, the morewill he be a Pole. If Poland does not allow him to think and feel freely, it means thatPoland does not allow him to be himself fully, that is, to be a Pole fully. . . .Does this still seem like sophistry? In that case let us look for examples inhistory. Germans in Hitler’s day stoked adoration of the nation to a white heat, yetthis kind of German was almost a fabrication, completely deprived of his Goethetradition, bah, of his normal German humanity. Because of this, Germany becamemore powerful while the individual German became weaker because he had tosurrender a part of his individual strength and resilience to the nation and, what ismore, to become less typical, less real as a German. Let us take France next. Is, forexample, a Frenchman who sees nothing but France more of a Frenchman? Orless of one? But to really be a Frenchman means exactly that: to see somethingbeyond France.A simple law. Collective strength is the sum of concessions each person300Volume 2extracts from himself . . . that is how the power of an army, state, or church iscreated. The power of a nation. But this happens at the expense of the individual.And what if a nation is so geographically and historically situated that itcannot attain power? What then? That spontaneous and natural Polishness, con-tained in each of us, suffers a great loss because we have surrendered full honestyand freedom of the spirit in exchange for a collective power—which we have notgained because it is unattainable. And what then? We immolate ourselves butnothing but smoke remains of the sacriﬁce.Thus my desire to ‘‘overcome Poland’’ was synonymous with the desire tostrengthen our individual Polishness. I simply wanted the Pole to stop being theproduct ‘‘of’’ an exclusively collective life and ‘‘for’’ a collective life. I wanted tocomplete him. To legitimize his other pole—the pole of individual life—and stretchhim between the two. I wanted to have him between Poland and his own existence—in a perspective more dialectical and full of antinomies, conscious of his internalcontradictions and capable of exploiting them for his own development.

I strove for a Pole who could take pride in saying: I belong to an inferiornation. With pride. For, as you will easily see, such a statement degrades me in myrole as a member of the collectivity, but at the same time it raises me above thecollectivity: I did not allow myself to be cheated; I am capable of judging my ownposition in the world; I know how to take stock of my situation; I am therefore aman of full value. (Parenthetically speaking, only then would you be able to lovePoland without reservations—because it could no longer rob you of value.)I went even further in this demand than had been accepted—even theFrench, English, or Americans, who have inﬁnitely more freedom in this area thanwe, could not manage so extreme a formulation. After all, they didn’t need it! Theybelonged to powerful, dominant nations that not only did not ruin their personallives but even enhanced them. With us things were different, we could not allowour cultural past, our collective level, our convulsive history, our national poverty,to delineate our limits. No, it had not been my intention at all just to relax ourpatriotism to the English or French level. To Poles I proposed a stance toward thenation that was even more radical—without precedent—something that wouldimmediately set us apart from the bulk of nations, would make us a nation with an1957301exclusively different style.—Madness!—you will say.—A pipe dream!—Really?—Iwill ask.—And why are we the most fervent patriots in the world? Isn’t it exactlybecause there is material in us to be the coldest antipatriots? In us the stoked love ofhomeland has reached its maximum, our dependence on it has become the worstimaginable—therefore, it is from us, not from anyone else, that the salutary antith-esis will spring, the creative opposition that will be a step forward.I didn’t consider myself a dreamer in this—on the contrary, I was faithful toa realism that had entered my bloodstream much earlier. I had no doubt thatPoles—tired and despairing because of the history of their homeland—live with anambivalent feeling at the bottom of their hearts. Did they adore It? Yes, but theyalso cursed It. Love It? Yes, but they also hated It. It was holiness and a cursefor them, strength and weakness, their pride and humiliation—but Polish style,formed and imposed by the collectivity, with only one side of the coin allowed tobe expressed. Our literature, for example, deprived of all real individualism, couldmanage to express nothing but afﬁrmation of the nation. And that reluctant,hostile, indifferent, or scornful feeling remained unacknowledged and meanderedon its own as sin, anarchy. . . . Thus all my efforts boiled down to creating aprinciple that would allow me to set into motion openly this second pole of feeling,to reach this facet of the Polish soul, to sanction the heresy.

I wielded mighty arguments. Of course, a basic turnabout in our relationswith the nation could be achieved only in the name of individual dignity, individ-ual development. And this position was inordinately strong and timely, both asmuch among the émigrés as in Poland, as in the entire world—for the necessity todefend what was once called the human soul grows stronger under deforming andinhuman collective powers.Something else also troubled me. Yes, as I have already said, I hated thenation because I couldn’t bear it; and I couldn’t bear it because of cowardice. Butin this case what were my advice and lessons worth if they derived from my basicinability to cope with life? I, a decadent, how could I point the way to healthyindividuals?But this terrible problem, being not just my own torment, had already beenmulled over several times. For it is well known that progress and development are302Volume 2not the work of people who are of average health, of those who barely have aninkling . . . but are worked out by deformed persons, exiled from decent ‘‘nor-mality.’’ A sick man is better able to grasp the absolute essence of health—becausehe does not possess it, he longs for it. He who lacks an internal balance cantherefore become an expert on matters of balance, and the advice of a deformedman can be useful to a healthy life. Those who because of personal ﬂaws cannotjoin the herd and who wander the peripheries see the path of the herd more clearlyand know the surrounding forest better.I believed then, and believe to this day, that the embarrassing genesis of myidea should not hurt—that a thought born in the little hell of my insufﬁciency,softened by childhood, could become objectively important. And healthy. On thecondition that (beginning with myself ) I do not conceal of what and how it wasconceived.I am not selling a cat in a sack. Feet and cards on the table, if you please—you have me just as I am, I am not praising the merchandise—if my existence canbe of some use to you, use it in any way you wish.

The consequences of such a change in our attitude toward Poland wouldbe rich and profound—it would cause a series of refreshing and electrifying revi-sions, ensuring us dynamic development for quite a while. For example—a revi-sion of Polish history. I do not claim it would be necessary to liquidate the historicalschool that analyzes the span of our history from the vantage point of Poland’sexistence, recognizing as positive that which promotes this existence, and negativethat which stands in its way. However, this school should be supplemented by adifferent one in which history would be considered from the perspective of thedevelopment of man in Poland—and then it might turn out that these two develop-ments, of the state and of the individual, do not always go hand in hand and thatperiods that were the most successful for the nation were perhaps not the happiestfor the individual. At any rate, it might be clear that these two developments are notidentical. This, however, would not be of primary importance.The most important thing would be that ﬁnally we could get at least onefoot out of history . . . and thereby regain our footing, we who are so swiftly borneunder by the vortices of our past. For in no longer being forced to love and worship1957303Polishness, we would not need to love our history. Seeing our value not in what weare but in what we are capable of overcoming in ourselves, our current form, wecould relate to history as an enemy. I am the result of my history. But this result inno way pleases me. I know, I feel, that I am worthy of something better and I do notintend to give up my rights. I base my value on my dissatisfaction with myself as ahistorical product. In which case my history becomes the history of my deformityand I turn against it—thus freeing myself from it.Allow me to dream. This would be a monumental achievement of thespirit—it would be as if we had come out of a river and felt the ground under ourfeet. I am not saying that this new, cold, perhaps reluctant, perhaps sarcastic orscornful tone in Polish history would become the key to opening up whole regionsof our past, blocked until now—and that, for the ﬁrst time, we could speak directlyabout the great creators of our national personality. The problem is more serious. Itwould mean no more or less than our wanting to begin our life from the beginningand our ceasing to be only a consequence of the past. This, in one fell swoop,would allow us to resist the current history that is being perpetrated upon us now.We could extricate ourselves both from the past and from the current moment inone leap and we could judge both—in the name of our ordinary humanity, ourordinary human needs and our universality. Let us not forget that only by opposinghistory as such can we oppose today’s history— tertium non datur. Yet let us also not forget that I want to be neither extreme nor dryly theoretical in this matter and thatI do not lose sight of the rich variety of life—I do not aim to eradicate an afﬁrminglove but only to enrich our possibilities by activating, as I have already said, theother pole of our antinomy, by revealing the other side of the Polish coin.So much for history. But I have also wished that we could revise our art . . .because it is not mandatory that we be sentenced to adore forever our own artisticworks and the forms they have shaped. This forced adoration is parochialism; itleads to upsetting the proportions between us and the world (that is, reality); and itis also prickly with complexes and breeds stupidity, lies, pretentiousness . . . butwhat is more and most important is that we do not know how to adequately scornrubbish because it is ours and this renders us defenseless against it; we have toadjust ourselves to our expression even when it doesn’t know how to express us. Ihave already tried to talk about literature in this diary, not as a source of nationalpride but often as something of a national calamity—and this, in my opinion, is not304Volume 2bad, this tone is worthy of commendation because it is the only way to avoid havingliterature cut us down to its size, so that we might realize ourselves as somethingbetter than what we have produced.These are only two examples to indicate the far-reaching practical conse-quences of ideas. Of course—there has never been a lack of various ‘‘self-criticisms’’;so many times have we settled accounts with our ‘‘national ﬂaws.’’ This was tempo-rary, stopgap self-criticism, however, that clung spasmodically to Polishness, whilesomewhere in its depths it conﬁrmed Polishness as an absolute value. What I speakof would be more conscious, more categorical, more basic—a position from whichwe could reach for world citizenship.

Communicating by means of art is an amusing misunderstanding. A prosework mixed with poetry is not a mathematical model and is different in each head.Much, much depends on the head. Not long ago I read the following in the Polishpress about Trans-Atlantic: ‘‘Here Gombrowicz’s intention is unusually accurateand appropriate: to depict through the distortions of the grotesque and parodic,and to accomplish a vicious satire of the sanacja* regime. . . .’’Thus establishing my intentions, the author laments that subsequently,everything disintegrates. Ecce head!—like a melon born from the soil of their socialpressure. . . . But I am certain that more than one will follow in his footsteps. Fortoday people demand, not a gratuitous, but a utilitarian art, harnessed to thegrindstone, industrious as a blind horse. And for many, Trans-Atlantic will fall apartright after the ﬁrst few pages, after the scene of the talk with the Minister, ‘‘ah, sucha clever satire on ministers, bureaucracy, all as it should be, but then later nothingbut fantasies, complexes. . . .’’Trans-Atlantic does not fall apart. Its construction is my success; it is agradual sinking into a deeper and deeper phantasmagoria, the growth of my ownautonomous reality; the whole point is that the world is nothing but itself. It is not asatire. It is not a ‘‘settling of accounts with the national conscience.’’ It is notphilosophy. It is not a philosophy of history. What is it then? A story I told. Inwhich, among other things, Poland appears. But it is not Poland that is the subject;
*Political movement of supporters of Pi™sudski after his death.1957305the subject, as always, is I, I alone, these are my adventures, not Poland’s. Exceptthat I just happen to be a Pole.This in itself is a satire inasmuch as my existence as a Pole in this world isa satire.This is not the fruit of an early pondering of the Polish question—I waswriting about myself—myself in Buenos Aires—only later did I begin to think aboutPoland—and now I draw these thoughts, like so much explosive contraband that Icarried unknowingly, from the hull of my bottomless ocean liner.One way or another, it was this ship that took me back to Poland.I returned, but no longer as a wild man. For I had, at one time during myyouth in Poland, been completely wild in relation to it, incapable of handling itwith style, incapable even of speaking about it—it served only to torment me.Later, in America, I found myself beyond Poland, adrift. Today things are different:I return with speciﬁc demands, I know what I must exact from my fellow Poles andI know what I can give them in return. Thus have I become a citizen.3061958

The New Year, approaching from the east with a speed equal to the rota-tion of the earth, caught and overtook me in La Cabania at Du´ s’s house, while I saton a couch holding a glass of champagne. Du´ s sat in an armchair under a lamp.Marisa next to the radio. Andrea on the arm of another chair. No one else.Scattered chessmen in front of Du´s.A dramatic moment. What will happen? What will the future, havingarrived, give birth to? ‘‘If only I didn’t have nightmares . . .’’ Perhaps we’ll getthrough it without catastrophe. The coming of the new year is the rushing, theterrible rushing of time, humanity, the world, everything is racing like mad into thefuture and the magnitude of this astronomical race takes one’s breath away. I spedalong with everyone else, my destiny rolled from one year into the next with aboom, and, at this very minute, this second, something has happened even thoughnothing has happened. The year has begun.My growing sensitivity to the calendar. Dates. Anniversaries. Periods. Withwhat diligence I now surrender myself to this tallying of dates. Yes, yes . . . whydidn’t I write down something every single day from the moment I learned towrite? Today I would have many volumes ﬁlled with notes, and I would know whatI did twenty-seven years ago at this exact hour. What for? Life escapes throughdates, just as water runs through one’s ﬁngers. But at least something would haveremained . . . some trace. . . .My concluding history begins to give me an almost sensual delight. Iimmerse myself in it as in a strange river that strives for clariﬁcation. Slowly1958307everything is ﬁlling out. Everything is concluding. I am beginning to deciphermyself, though still with difﬁculty, as if I were looking through hazy glasses. Howstrange: ﬁnally, ﬁnally I begin to see my own face making its way out of Time,accompanied by the foretaste of irrevocable ﬁnality. Pathos.
Wednesday
I was walking along a eucalyptus-lined avenue when a cow sauntered outfrom behind a tree.I stopped and we looked each other in the eye.Her cowness shocked my humanness to such a degree—the moment oureyes met was so tense—I stopped dead in my tracks and lost my bearings as a man,that is, as a member of the human species. The strange feeling that I was appar-ently discovering for the ﬁrst time was the shame of a man come face-to-face withan animal. I allowed her to look and see me—this made us equal—and resulted inmy also becoming an animal—but a strange even forbidden one, I would say. Icontinued my walk, but I felt uncomfortable . . . in nature, surrounding me on allsides, as if it were . . . watching me.
Thursday
Today, after breakfast, a discussion—Verena, Du´ s, Jacek, and I—provokedby my contention that a man on a horse is a weird and ridiculous thing, an af-front to aesthetics. In this equine Acropolis, my thesis struck like a blasphemousthunderbolt.I explained that an animal is not born to carry another animal on its back. Aman on a horse is as weird as a rat riding a rooster, a chicken riding a camel, amonkey riding a cow, or a dog riding a buffalo. A man on a horse is a scandal, anupsetting of the natural order of things, violent artiﬁciality, dissonance, ugliness.They called on works of sculptors celebrating the equestrian. I laughed in theirfaces. Statues! Why art has always paid homage to convention—it was almost likefashion! Custom decides everything. For centuries we have looked at equestrianstatues just as we have looked at men on horseback, but if we rubbed our eyes and308Volume 2looked afresh, we would scowl in distaste—because a horse’s back is no more aplace for man than the back of a cow.We discussed this during a morning stroll while sixty thoroughbred maresin the pastures ﬁxed their soft, warm eyes upon us. And I attacked horseback riding.A delight? A pleasant and beautiful amusement? Ha, ha, ha! Jumping up and downon a beast, rising and falling with legs spread apart, bouncing a butt off the inevita-ble back, astride an unwieldy and stupid beast, difﬁcult to mount, just as difﬁcult todismount, and almost impossible to steer? ‘‘Race’’ on it with the speed of a bicycle?Or repeat again and again the same one-hundred-thousandth jump over an obsta-cle, on an animal that does not lend itself at all to jumping? Struggle with thisdesperate equine ungainliness, which can never really be overcome? Why, theseso-called delights are pure atavism! There was a time when the horse was indeeduseful, he determined the superiority of a man, a man governed others from ahorse, a horse was wealth, power, the pride of its rider. The cult of horseback ridingand the adoration of a quadruped, which is an anachronism, have survived thoseantediluvian times. You automatically imitate the admiration of your grandfathersand bruise your seats to honor the myth!The monstrousness of my blasphemy echoed wildly from one end of thehorizon to the other. The master and slave of sixty purebred mares eyed me wanly.
Thursday
Cows.When I pass a herd of cows, they turn their heads toward me and their eyesdo not leave me until I pass. Just like at the Russoviches’ in Corrientes. But then Ipaid no attention, whereas now, after the matter of ‘‘the cow who saw me,’’ theselooks seem like seeing to me. Grass and herbs! Trees and ﬁelds! The green natureof the world! I immerse myself in this expanse as if I were pushing off fromshore and a presence consisting of a billion beings overwhelms me. O pulsating,living matter! Resplendent sunsets; today two white-and-coffee-brown islands—mountains and towers of glowing stalactites—rose before me in a crown of rubies.The islands melted together creating a bay of mystic azure so utterly withoutblemish that I almost believed in God—and then dark, creeping billows gath-1958309ered right over the horizon—just one luminous point, a single beating heart oflight, remained among the deep brown bellies of clouds crowding the horizon.Hosanna! I don’t really want to write about this; after all, so many sunsets havebeen described in literature, and especially in ours.I mean to say something else. The cow. How am I supposed to act towarda cow?Nature. How am I supposed to behave toward nature?So I head down the road, surrounded by pampa—and I feel that I am aforeigner in all of this nature, I, in my human skin . . . a stranger. Disturbinglydifferent. A separate creature. And I see that Polish descriptions of nature, like allothers, are worthless to me in this sudden opposition between nature and myhumanity. An opposition clamoring for a resolution.Polish descriptions of nature. So much art has been invested in them withwhat hopeless results. How long have we been smelling the ﬂowers, basking insunsets, immersing our faces in clumps of spring-green foliage, inhaling earlymornings and singing hymns in honor of the Creator: who thought up thesewonders? But this humble and profound prostrating of ourselves, kneeling, snifﬁngand smelling, has merely removed us from the most unrelenting human truth—namely, that man is not natural, he is antinatural.If the nation to which I belong had felt at one time that it differed in itsessence from a horse, it was only because the Church lectured it about the immor-tal human soul. But who created that soul? God. And who created the horse? God.Thus man and horse merge in the harmony of that beginning. The contrastbetween them is reconcilable.I am getting to the end of the eucalyptus-lined road. It is getting dark. Thequestion: am I, deprived of God, closer to or farther from nature as a result of this?Answer: I am farther away. And even this opposition between me and naturebecomes, without Him, impossible to mend—here there is no appeal to a highertribunal.But even if I were to believe in God, the Catholic view of nature would beimpossible for me, in contradiction to my entire consciousness, at odds with mysensibility—and this because of the problem of pain. Catholicism has treated all ofcreation, except for man, with disdain. It is difﬁcult to imagine a more Olympian310Volume 2indifference to ‘‘their’’ pain—‘‘theirs,’’ the pain of plants or animals. Man’s pain hasa free will and, therefore, is punishment for sins, and his future life will make justamends for the injustices of this world. But the horse? Worm? They have beenforgotten. Their suffering is deprived of justice—a naked fact gaping with theabsolute of despair. I am bypassing the complex dialectic of the holy doctors. Ispeak of the average Catholic, who, walking in the light of a justice that endowshim with everything he deserves, is deaf to the immeasurable abyss of that—unjustiﬁed—suffering. Let them suffer! This does not concern him. Why, theyhave no souls. Let them suffer, therefore, senselessly. Yes, it would be difﬁcult toﬁnd a teaching that concerns itself less with the world beyond man (the ahumanworld); this is a doctrine proudly human, cruelly aristocratic—and how can we besurprised that it has led us into a state of blissful unconsciousness and holy inno-cence regarding nature, which surfaces in our idyllic descriptions of dawn or dusk.
Friday
I am pushed toward these lower strata, toward a confrontation with horse,beetle, plant, by my striving for ‘‘contact with inferiority.’’ If I try to make superiorconsciousness dependent on the lower consciousness in the human world—if Iwant to bind maturity to immaturity—shouldn’t I descend even lower on theladder of the species? To embrace the entire downward scale?But—I am reluctant . . . I admit—this bores me. I do not feel like thinkingabout this. And I don’t like, I practically can’t stand—to travel in thought beyondthe human kingdom. Is it because the kingdoms surrounding us are too enor-mous? A reluctance to stray too far from one’s own home?To understand nature, to look at it, examine it—that’s one thing. But if Iattempt to get close to it as if it were something that is equal to me because of thelife common to all of us—when I want to be on friendly terms with animals orplants—I am overwhelmed by an obstinate lethargy. I lose animation, I return allthe more quickly to my human house and I lock the door.Let us write this down, because who knows if this is not one of the mostimportant characteristics of my humanity: some sort of resistance appears in meand takes the form of boredom, fatigue, whenever I want to grasp and recognizethat lower life.1958311Friday
Today ‘‘I became a ﬂy killer,’’ which simply means that I killed ﬂies with mywire swatter.Who knows where the ﬂies come from (the windows in my room havescreens). I liquidate them this way almost every day. Today I killed about forty. Ofcourse, I don’t kill all of them right away—some of them, seriously mangled, fall tothe ﬂoor, and every so often I ﬁnd such a ﬂy, left to face its death alone. I imme-diately ﬁnish him off. But it does occasionally happen that one escapes into a crackin the ﬂoor, and becomes inaccessible to me with its pain.In my youth I tortured animals. I remember how in Ma™oszyce I amusedmyself with the country boys. We chopped up frogs with whips. Today I am afraid—this is the right word—of the suffering of a ﬂy. And this fear, in turn, terriﬁes me, asif some awful weakness toward life were contained in it. I am in fact afraid of this,that I cannot bear the pain of a ﬂy. With age, I underwent a general evolution,whose tragic and malignant character I do not want to hide; on the contrary, Iwould like to emphasize it as strongly as I can. And I claim that it is characteristicnot just of me, but of my entire generation.I will note its salient points:
(1)The devaluation of death.—Death, be it human or animal, becomes lessand less important to me. It is becoming more and more difﬁcult for meto understand people who consider taking someone’s life the greatestpunishment. I do not understand revenge, which is pleased to shootsomeone suddenly in the back of the head—as if that person felt some-thing. I have become almost completely indifferent to death (I am nottalking about my own).(2)The enthronement of pain.—Pain becomes the starting point of existence,the basic experience from which everything begins, to which everythingis reduced. Existentialists with their ‘‘life for death’’ do not satisfy me, Iwould pit life only against pain.(3)Pain as pain, pain in itself.—This is the most important of all. Only thisshift in feeling is really horrifying and awful and enormous. It relies onmy caring less and less about who suffers. . . . I think that currently twoschools of thought exist on this point. For people of the old school, the312Volume 2pain of someone in the family is, aside from their own, the worst: the painof a dignitary is more important than the pain of a peasant; the pain of apeasant is more important than the pain of a boy; the pain of a boy ismore important than the pain of a dog. They exist in a limited circle ofpain. But for people of the more recent school, pain is pain wherever itappears, equally horrifying in man as in a ﬂy; in us the experience of puresuffering has become informed, our hell has become universal. Someconsider me insensitive because it is difﬁcult for me to hide that the painof those nearest to me is not the pain nearest to me. And my whole natureis attuned to discovering that—lower—suffering.
God-fearing families—as I recall from bygone days—sat in their countrymanors at supper, speaking decently, innocently . . . while ﬂypaper dangled rightover the table, and on the ﬂypaper ﬂies in predicaments worse than those of thedamned in medieval paintings. This did not disturb anyone because in the sen-tence ‘‘the pain of a ﬂy’’ the accent fell on ‘‘ﬂy’’ not ‘‘pain.’’ Today it is enough tospray a room with insecticide for clouds of tiny beings to begin to writhe—and noone pays any attention.Yes. But how am I to reconcile my discovery of universal suffering withwhat I jotted down yesterday—with my reluctance to recognize the ahuman, in-ferior, world? This is one of the strangest rifts within me. I am overcome by inferiorsuffering and my entire being is attuned to uncovering it. Yet an icy boredom,almost drowsiness, overtakes me when I want to equate myself with these creaturesin existence and try to acknowledge their full right to exist. This is a tedious andsluggish desire—is it tedious and sluggish because it exceeds my strength? To what,therefore, has the evolution, contained in the three points above, led me, me andmany more like me? We are even more muddled—and even more uncertain inrelation to nature than people of bygone times, who, one has to admit, exhibitedmore style in these matters than we do.Dus had a dream about Bishop Krasicki who, upon closer inspection,turned into Witkacy. Witkacy puckered his lips which stretched into a little snout,and with this bustling little snout expressed the desire that Dus compose a ‘‘sib-ilant’’ poem for him, a ‘‘susurrous’’ poem. Dus became shishkabobish and shad-bushy and set about composing a poetic work of which he could recall only a fewstanzas upon awakening.1958313They whisperedIn the bulrush shrouded shack of Schlomo the shrewmouseStephen Owlglass and Simon OwlclawOwlglass, Owlclaw . . .
In Owlglass the grotesque predominates but in Owlclaw it begins to bristlewith menace, he has talons. . . . The wonder of these names—they haunted me fora long time.I remembered and declaimed the poem that Witkacy composed about me,and in which I detect a powerful prophecy because at that time, before I hadwritten Ferdydurke, neither I nor anyone else knew that immaturity would becomemy cheval de bataille.
His ﬁrst name was Witold, surname GombrowiczOn the surface he appeared a common strollerowiczBut in him an unknown wildness dweltThat one day would make the horse a ﬁne colt!
So Dus (because he was with Edith—a teacher in a girls’ school and astudent of philosophy with that typically American ravenousness—we discussedcertain ‘‘transcendental’’ issues) composed this triﬂe.
Set aside for a moment your pipeAnd seriously, for the fun of it,Drunk on a gulp of stupidityTell them with much embroideryAbout the essence of beingAnd after you have padded the talePounce on their being once moreAnd explode their imagination
Wednesday
Mail. A clipping from a newspaper in Poland—I learn about the program‘‘Witold Gombrowicz’s Books’’ on Radio Warsaw. And about Artur Sandauer’s talk,in which he said, among other things: ‘‘Today it is difﬁcult to imagine how a writerwho is the pride of the Polish nation, whose ‘unrealistic’ books surpass all other314Volume 2realistic—holy God, forgive us—masterpieces, was sentenced by our cultural bu-reaucrats to so many years of exile.’’My independence, self-sufﬁciency, or even frivolous impudence, my tak-ing potshots at everyone, universal provocation and exclusive reliance on myself—all of this was a result of my social and geographical situation. I was forced not topay attention to anyone because no one paid any attention to me—I was formed inalmost complete isolation—I think that few literati have known such extremeisolation. In prewar Poland I was treated nonchalantly, almost ignored—then I wascrushed by the war—then I was put on the censor’s index by the Communistregime—and here, in Argentina, I was deprived of even a literary café, of even agroup of artist friends in whose bosom every gypsy, innovator, avant-gardist can curlup in the cities of Europe. I became bold because I had absolutely nothing to lose:neither honors, nor earnings, nor friends. I had to ﬁnd myself anew and rely onlyon myself, because I could rely on no one else. My form is my solitude.Well, yes . . . until suddenly . . . I am the ‘‘pride of the nation.’’ Can it be?Didn’t he get a bit carried away? I realize that my rebirth in Poland can be sudden.Polish publishers jumped at my books. And something has changed in the tone ofprivate letters and articles in the Polish press, I sense forces gathering around me,this growing wave may toss me aloft. Could this be?But this would completely change the address on the long letter that is mywriting. I wrote for my enemies—and now I will write for . . . the nation?(I am strolling down a eucalyptus-lined avenue and as it turns out—I amfurious! Chimangos—small hawks—screech and ﬂy directly over my head.)What if these shoulders should raise me on high?A sudden sharp turn. Oh, that it not throw me from the saddle. . . .What will I do there, at the top, with everything that formed itself indegradation? How does one move stylistically from degradation to elevation?Sandauer . . .Luckily (unfortunately!) it is more than doubtful that the nation will be sodocile as to agree with Sandauer’s opinion. I know that for the time being I will stillhave to win people in Poland to my side—one at a time.Yet if I were ﬁnally able to become ‘‘the pride of the nation’’?This tormenting riddle . . .When such exciting piropos fall on you, let your frustration think, for its1958315own health, about the high-ﬂown adjectives bestowed upon your fellow writers. Noneed to worry. Yet . . . I cannot rid myself of the certainty that my victories are morereal than the victories of poets like Tuwim, let’s say, or Lecho ´ n.* Insofar as my art is less conventional . . . and more difﬁcult . . . and more original and written againstthe current. Ferdydurke, if it is victorious, is more victorious. . . .. . . This makes me ridiculous. My delighting in this, my excitement, makesme ridiculous and offends me. I am offended. Pride. Obstinacy. Cold. Distrust.Opposition. ‘‘To not allow oneself to be pulled into the nation.’’My literature must remain that which it is. Especially that somethingwhich does not ﬁt into politics and does not want to serve it. I cultivate just onepolitics: my own. I am a separate state. Perhaps now, when they approach me withoutstretched arms . . . is when the battle really begins. This is an attack from theirside—an attempt to conquer and I must defend myself!!(I am incensed. I know that I am incensed. I know that I know that I amincensed. Because I know that I am incensed, I thrash my arms [no one sees]—I,‘‘pride of the nation’’! What strength, at such moments, is my childhood!)
Friday
The eucalyptus-lined avenue all the way to the end, this time at dusk,under the sign of two disturbing thoughts.
(1) That nature is ceasing to be nature for us in the old sense of the word(when it represented harmony and peace).(2) That man is ceasing to be man in the old sense of the word (when he felthimself to be a harmonious part of nature).
The twilight hour is incredible . . . there is such an imperceptible andinevitable evaporation of form. . . . It is preceded by a moment of enormous clarity,as if form were resisting, didn’t want to give in—the clarity of everything is tragic,persistent, even frenzied. Right after the moment when the object becomes itselfmost concrete, alone and left to itself, without the play of light and shadow inwhich it luxuriated until now, a more pervasive weakening, evaporation of matter
*Julian Tuwim and Jan Lecho ´ n were the most successful and well-known Polish poets inthe interwar period.316Volume 2follows; lines and blots join causing a tiring blur; contours put up no resistance; theoutlines, in dying, become difﬁcult, incomprehensible; there is a general retreat,withdrawal, a sinking into growing complexity. . . . Before the actual coming ofdarkness the shape becomes stronger once more, but not with the power of whatwe see but with the power of what we know about it—the cry proclaiming itspresence is now merely theoretical. . . . After which there is a mixing of everything,blackness pours out of holes, thickens in space, and matter becomes darkness.Nothing. Night.I groped my way home. I walked hard and stiff straight ahead, drowned inunseeing, absolutely certain that I was a demon, an antihorse, antitree, antinature,a being from elsewhere, a newcomer, foreigner, alien. A phenomenon not of thisworld. Of another world. The human world.I returned completely unaware that somewhere, close by, was a terrifying dog,crouching, ready to lunge for the throat, pin to the wall. . . . But enough . . . for now.
IV
To be with nature or against it? The thought that man is contradictory tonature, something beyond and in opposition to it, will soon cease being an elitistthought. It will reach even the peasants. It will penetrate the entire human racefrom top to bottom. What then? When the last reserves of ‘‘naturalness’’—derivingfrom the lower strata—exhaust themselves?
Tuesday
Yesterday evening a neighbor, Tadeusz Czerwi ´ nski, came to visit and rightoff began to tell us something, but we were not listening closely and his narrativetook shape very slowly. . . . Du´ s’s hounds (we ﬁnally understood him to say) had runinto Garanio’s ﬁeld and attacked a sow. Garanio had jumped out with a shotgun,killed one of the hounds, and wounded another—the rest escaped. I am giving onlythe crux of the narration, which was rich in branches, like a tree.Du´s ran out onto the porch with a ﬂashlight, and the golden hounds, asusual, rose at seeing him and surrounded him. But there were only ﬁve—Step andone young hound, by Saeta, were missing.1958317Thirteen-year-old Andrea burst into tears. Du´ s’s rancor—rising like thesong of Isolde—prevailed over all else. He would have exchanged his most belovedhorses for Step. He had a desperate face—and this was a face that was strangelyweakened, like the face of a small child—weakened perhaps by the pettiness of thatdespair, on account of a mere dog . . . for which he could not demand fullrecognition from us.He took a revolver out of a drawer—got on a horse—and a gallop bore himaway into the night. We waited, disturbed and helpless in the face of the anger thatvanished into the ﬁelds, carried off by a horse. Would he kill Garanio for killing thedog? No, it didn’t end that badly. Du´ s, upon arriving at Garanio’s estancia andseeing Garanio’s dogs, wanted to shoot them—but the estanciero came running outand began asking his forgiveness, explaining that he had acted in defense of a sow,whom the dogs would have torn to pieces. So the anger left poor Du´ s and onlysorrow for his most faithful dog remained: Why did you do this to me? he asked. Ihave always been a good neighbor. He left. He began searching for the bodies inthe night. He found them. It turned out that Step was still alive. Hidden in thebushes, he was dying. He was brought home on that strange sleigh that one useshere on the ground as one might elsewhere on snow.Du´s, Jacek D˛ ebicki, Miss Jeanne, and I went to the stable—there was thedog, gasping and shaking spasmodically. Council: cut short his agony? His suffer-ing was terrifying—and he was locked in it, inaccessible to us, separate, alone.The scene that disturbed me: night, the stable, all of us practically in thedark hovering over an unleashed, diabolical pain. We were capable of putting anend to this. . . . It would have been enough to shoot. Would we shoot? We, fourhuman beings ‘‘from another world,’’ a higher world, four demons from anti-nature, four antidogs. The only things that joined us to this creature was ourunderstanding of its pain—we knew the taste.Should we put an end to the torment? A vote. But this demands a moredetailed narrative.The ﬁrst antidog, Miss Jeanne. Handsome, twenty years old, multimillion-aire parents, herself shuttled from Paris to Rome, from Rome to London to theStates, on ships, airplanes, ﬁrst-rate schools, luxurious institutes, always different,out of which she has gotten nothing except the ﬁve languages she wields like anative. Which language does she think in? Luxurious—and a Communist—be-318Volume 2cause luxurious—from the excess, the surfeit. . . . Sober, energetic, spunky—modern and an atheist. Seeing her bent over the dog, I realized that Communistjustice, just like Catholic justice, does not include animals. Within this doctrinehumanity ends with man. It forbids the exploitation of one human being byanother—but agrees to the exploitation of animals. Which is, let us add, incompre-hensible. It is not all well and good. For if religions casts animals into the margin,as soulless, then materialism acknowledges no basic difference between this suffer-ing matter and human matter. . . . How then will Miss Jeanne act toward thesuffering dog—if her reasoned morality has nothing to say? What will she do?She made a female of herself! Strange . . . in a wink, she undressedherself . . . not so much of her communism, but of her humanity. She suddenlychanged into a female—she took refuge in her sex . . . what a sudden eruption ofgender into the realm of pain, as if gender could cope somehow with the pain. . . .She became a female, that is, love, that is, pity. She bent over the dog with amother’s tenderness. Is it possible that as a female she could do more than as a hu-man being? Or, did she retreat into her sex in order to escape her own humanity?When she became a woman, however, death seemed worse than pain toher. She began to love the dog cruelly—demanding his life even at the price of hispain.—No, no—she said, trembling.—Don’t kill him!The second antidog from a higher human sphere. Jacek D˛ ebicki. A zeal-ous Catholic. Yet his Catholicism is as useless here as Miss Jeanne’s communism.Nor is God a factor. There is no salvation for the dog. And hence my impressionthat in leaning over the dog, he was leaning away from God—he is now ‘‘face-to-face’’ with the dog and therefore not ‘‘face-to-face’’ with God. An entirely differentregister of existence. He is ‘‘with the dog’’ as if, giving up his immortal soul, he puthimself on its level, identiﬁed with it in its suffering. And out of the blue ananimal—rebellious and blasphemous—terror of pain mounts in him. But what do Isee? I see (because I almost saw this, rather, I ‘‘knew’’ this) that in another registerhe is not getting rid of even an iota of his Roman Catholic dignity, and the terrorchanges into pity . . . a legalized . . . civilized . . . well brought up . . . ah, I almostforgot that God, himself ruthless to animals, allows man to pity them—so he isallowed; he even has the ‘‘approval’’ of the Church! But the humanity that herediscovered in himself is not a fraternal socializing with the animal but with hisown humanity, that is, with his feeling of the dog’s pain from on high—from the1958319distance of that soul—and, what’s more, he again possesses an element of non-chalance and cruelty. The decision he makes will be dictated by three consider-ations: ﬁrst of all, by his animal compassion, which is almost wild, spontaneous;second, by his more human and spiritualized calculation that the soulless life of adog is not of great signiﬁcance; and third (a thought even more spiritual), that oneshould end this ordeal—which is somewhat embarrassing to God and the soul—assoon as possible.Kill him—he said.—He won’t make it.The third antidog. Me. For me, there is no higher authority. Even the dogdoesn’t exist. Only a piece of suffering matter writhing before me. Unbearable. Icannot stand it. Gripped by the suffering in this stable, I demand that an end beput to it. Kill him! Kill him! Stop the machine of pain! Let this not be! There isnothing else one can do, just this! But this we can do!The fourth antidog: Du´ s. Agronomist, landowner, a hunter, sportsman,horseman, and lover of hounds. Between him and us—a complete disharmony; heis from a different reality. He is not afraid of pain ‘‘as such,’’ as I am. He does notseek universal justice, like this Catholic or that Communist. He disregards abstrac-tions, does not grasp them, does not want to. He exists among creatures of ﬂesh andblood, he is a creature among creatures, a body among bodies. In the depths of hisspirit, he does not know what equality is. He is the master. He has come to love thisdog; therefore, he would, without scruple, sentence forty million ants and tenthousand whales to suffer . . . if it would bring relief to the dog. For this creatureclose to him, he is ready for any sacriﬁce but he does not want to know everything,identify with everything, he wants to remain within the circle of his own limitedfeeling. He would rather not see what is beyond his gaze. And he has come to lovethe dog with the love of a master. He loves the dog because it adores him—he lovesthe canine adoration in the dog. Therefore, the egoism of the master and ruler, thearistocratic feeling born of a ruthless human superiority, all of nature exists forhim, it serves him, he, subordinating to himself all inferior beings, is the dispenserof favors. And he seemed to me to be the most ‘‘anti’’ of all of us—in that darkstable, leaning over the dog, the absolute king of creation, proclaiming: everythingexists for me.But perhaps this was most consistent with nature. And if the dog couldunderstand, he would understand him, not us!320Volume 2With the delicacy of a griefstricken mother, he said: Let us wait. Perhaps hewon’t die.It is a ﬁerce love that prolongs agony in order to save the dog—for itself.This dramatic scene would not have been so tense and urgent if not for thewheezing of the dog, his eyes following our every move.
Thursday
Necochea. The seaside.I walk straight ahead along an enormous beach, hardened and brown fromthe daily tides that ﬂood it. The houses of Necochea disappear behind the cliffs.Emptiness, sand, undulation—that drowning, soporiﬁc thunder. Space—distance—boundlessness. Before me, all the way to Australia, nothing but furrowedwater and its gleaming crest, to the south the Falkland and the South Orkneyislands—the polar cap. And behind me the ‘‘interior’’: Río Negro, the pampa. . . .Sea and space thundering in eyes and ears create confusion. I walk and leaveNecochea behind—until at last even its memory disappears and only the growingdistance persists, eternal, like a secret I take with me.I stay at the Hotel Shangri-La.
Sunday
I wander over to the Hotel Quequen, on the other side of the port, butthere is no one there from the Argentine high life* —none of the Anchorens, Santa Marinos, etc., I came to know through Du´ s and Henryk Soba ´ nski. They left because January had come to an end. Their grandparents gatheredin this hotel (at that time a ﬁrst-rate hotel) every year in January, which is why theyalso arrange a rendezvous in the Quequen (now an anachronistic hovel, bereft ofcomfort). In January this boliche squeaks with millions and rings with names.The local aristocracy, or rather the so-called oligarchy, consists of a few fam-ilies whose genealogical tree begins with the sudden wealth of a great-grandfather.But these millions are weighty. The inﬂuence of money is so strong on people thata few generations of such wealth is enough for the differences between them and,
*‘‘High life’’ in English in original.1958321let us say, the Radziwi™™s, to be minimal. They look good and dress all rightand have impeccable manners—embedded in an aristocratic calm in their circle.But just in their circle. Unfortunately, I am the one who—when we confront eachother—knocks them off balance. An intellectual? Artist? Perhaps an atheist? Anar-chist? This embarrasses them, shames them, ﬁlls their provincial kindness withtrepidation . . . they fear tactlessness.
Monday
I met him on the beach. He was wonderful! He greeted me magnani-mously. He kindly asked how I was. With a majestic ﬁnger, he indicated the kioskwhere one could get langostinos. He smiled with the benevolence of a prince.With regal courtesy, he allowed me to go ﬁrst along the board leading to the cabin.All because he was not in pants but in bathing trunks.
Wednesday
. . . of the Mr. Grubi ´nski* type. Since Mr. Sakowski—although less Latin-Hellenic and daintily Renaissance—is really Grubi ´ nski—except not so mortify-ingly smooth. Their highest wisdom consists of the following: ‘‘All this has alreadybeen tried.’’ ‘‘There is nothing more banal than originality.’’ ‘‘The only things Ihave not become accustomed to are empty talk, affectation, and pitiful clichés.’’A credo typical of eunuchs! What an irony of fate that Wiadomo´ sci, whichin its Sturm und Drang Periode ate Grubi ´ nski alive every week, today, in old age,has two Grubi ´ nskis in its stable. Yet in a way it is a pity that Grydzewski did notdelegate a less ﬂimsy mind to discuss the Diary, which, for whatever it’s worth,contains a portion of my life. I hold nothing against Sakowski—the Diary wouldmiss at least one of its (less lofty) destinies if it did not provoke his type of mentality,and his reactions are, in this case, as natural as those of a cat whose tail has beenstepped on. I admit that I hurt him badly. I tore into the boudoir of his soul like abarbarian and I smashed his most beloved tomes of poetry; I trampled Tuwim, Idishonored Lecho ´ n, I profaned his dearest saints and sweetest delicacies, even Boy
*Grubi ´nski and Sakowski were Polish émigré writers in London.322Volume 2˙Zele ´nski. His entire little shrine in ruins! O horrors! This is the source of hisaversion to me, in his article, written in the parlé français style.And that little old man, Kajetan Morawski, was greatly concerned in thatsame issue of Wiadomo´ sci that I might be a ‘‘futurist.’’ God almighty, why this isKurier Warszawski,* redivivus!And if this were not enough, Janusz Kowalewski jumped on me, too—quarrelsome and inﬂexible, truculent and thrashing with his little feet. But thatwas in another newspaper.
Tuesday
Something happened yesterday . . . something like a continuation of thedog at the estancia. . . . And if I said that there is nothing equal somehow to therepugnance of the dilemma that I experienced . . . that I found myself wherehumanity must retch. . . . I could say this. I could also torment myself with it—it isreally up to me.I was lying in the sun, cleverly concealed in the mountain chain that sandforms when blown by the wind to the edges of the beach. These are mountains ofsand, dunes, abundant in ravines, slopes, valleys, a curving and shifting labyrinth,overgrown here and there with brush that vibrates under the unceasing toil of thewind. I was shielded by a substantial Jungfrau, nobly cubic, proud—when one ofthose hurricanes that endlessly lash this scorched Sahara kicked up about tencentimeters from my nose. Some sort of beetles—I don’t know what to call them—bustled along this desert for reasons unknown. And one of them, within my reach,lay upside down. The wind had overturned it. The sun beat on its belly, whichcertainly must have been unpleasant considering that this belly was usually left inthe shade—there he lay, thrashing his little legs—and it was obvious that nothingwas left to it except a monotonous and desperate thrashing of its legs—and it wasgrowing weak, perhaps it had been there for hours; it was dying.I, a giant, inaccessible to him in my enormity, an enormity that made meinvisible to it—I watched that thrashing of legs . . . and extending my hand,extricated him from his agony. He moved ahead, returned to life in a split second.
*Respectable, conservative newspaper in interwar Poland.1958323I had barely done this when I noticed a little farther away, an identicalbeetle in an identical predicament. And he, too, was thrashing his little legs. Ididn’t want to move. . . . But—why did you save that little guy and not this one? . . .Why that one . . . when this one? . . . You make one happy and the other shouldsuffer? I took a stick, extended my hand—and saved him.I had barely done this when I saw, somewhat farther, an identical beetle inan identical predicament. Thrashing his little legs. And the sun was beating downon his belly.Was I supposed to change my siesta into an ambulance for beetles in theirdeath throes? But I had become too friendly with these beetles, in their strangelyhelpless thrashing . . . and you will probably understand that once I had started therescuing, I had no right to stop at some arbitrary point. It would have been an awfulthing to do to this third beetle—to stop exactly at the threshold of his defeat . . . toocruel and somehow impossible to do. . . . Bah! if there had been some sort ofboundary between him and the ones I rescued, something that could have autho-rized me to stop—but there was absolutely nothing, only another ten centimetersof sand, always the same bit of sand, ‘‘a little farther away,’’ it is true, but only ‘‘alittle.’’ And he waved his little legs in the same way! Looking around, however, Inoticed ‘‘just a little’’ farther, another four beetles, thrashing and being scorched bythe sun—there was no helping it, I got up and rescued them all. Off they went.Then what should my eyes behold but the gleaming-hot-sandy plane of aneighboring slope and on it ﬁve or six little thrashing dots: beetles. I rushed to theirrescue. I saved them. And by this time I was so wrapped up in their suffering, I wasso absorbed by it, that, seeing new beetles all along the plains, ravines, and can-yons, an endless rash of tortured dots, I began to walk the sands as if I weredemented, rescuing, rescuing, rescuing! But I knew this could not last forever—forit was not just this beach, but the entire coast, as far as the eye could see; it was sownwith them so there had to come a moment when I would say ‘‘Enough!’’ The ﬁrstunrescued beetle would have to happen, too. Which one should it be? Whichone? Which one? Each time I said ‘‘this one’’—I saved it, unable to bear that awful,almost vile arbitrariness—because why this one, why this one? Until I ﬁnally brokedown, suddenly, easily, I suspended my empathy, stopped, thought indifferently,‘‘Well, time to go back,’’ and left. But the beetle, the beetle I stopped with, re-mained behind thrashing its little legs (all of this was a matter of complete indif-324Volume 2ference to me by now, as if I had grown disgusted with the game—but I knew thatthis indifference was imposed upon me by the circumstances and I carried itwithin me like a foreign object).
Thursday
The café on the rambli,* where at this evening hour there is dancing; asamba is underway, discretely elegant, beating from the windows along with thelight onto the immobility of rustling waters . . . all the way to the pole, to Australia.Sumampa. Such exotic names crouch behind me in the interior, still full of thelanguage of Indians so recently exterminated.Waiters. Young people dancing with abandon. Refrescos and helados . . .. . . And what if I said that the business with the bugs had been humiliating?And ‘‘dishonorable’’? But most of all, ‘‘basely helpless?’’ I could describe it this way.It all depends on me. Here at the dance I can surrender myself to disgrace, or askfor one more helping of ice cream and dismiss it as a silly incident with bugs.Yes, I am the master of my terrors, my fears. Which should be appalling tome? I must ﬁrst nod to the devil—then he will show himself. Perhaps I beckon toooften . . . and what’s more, I cultivate a certain category of fear, which I knowbelongs to the past—these are still fears in embryo, which will become trouble-some only to the generation now maturing.Numbers! The numbers! I had to abdicate from justice, from morality,from humanity—because I could not cope with the numbers. There were toomany of them. I’m sorry! But this is the same as saying that morality is impossible.Nothing more or less. Because morality must be the same in relation to all, other-wise it is unjust, and therefore immoral. But that number, that enormity of num-bers, concentrated itself on the one bug I didn’t rescue—on the one I stopped at.Why him and not a different one? Why must that one pay for the fact that there aremillions?My pity, ending at precisely that moment—no one knows exactly why atthat bug, the same as all the rest. There is something unbearable, impossible toswallow, in this inﬁnity suddenly made concrete—why that one?—why that one?—
*Pier.1958325The more I think about it, the stranger I begin to feel; I have the impression that Idispense only a partial morality . . . a fragmentary . . . an arbitrary . . . an unjust . . .morality, which (I don’t know if this is clear) is of its very nature not continuous butgranular.
Saturday
Painting . . . I don’t know. Maybe I exaggerate this phobia.I will not deny that in spite of everything, there is something in a painting,even if it is a faithful copy of nature, that disarms and attracts. What is it? A paintedlandscape undoubtedly says something else to us than does the same landscape innature; its effect on our soul is different. But not because a painting is morebeautiful than nature, no, a painting will always be incompetent beauty, beautyspoiled by the clumsy hand of man. It is possible, though, that this is the reasonbehind the attraction. The picture shows us the beauty that was felt, seen bysomeone like the painter. The picture not only says: ‘‘this landscape is beautiful,’’but also: ‘‘I saw this and was struck by it and that is why I painted it.’’If we consider that the contemplation of an object, whatever it may be(landscape, apple, house, man), ﬁlls us with the despair of loneliness—becausethen you ﬁnd yourself alone with the Thing and the Thing crushes you—perhapsthis fear of the thing, as such, would explain the paradoxical phenomenon that animperfectly painted trunk is closer to us than a natural trunk in all of its perfection.A painted tree trunk is a trunk ﬁltered through man.
Sunday
Today again, at tea, there was a discussion about painting at Atilio’s (whatelse could they possibly talk about?). The catch is, though, that one cannot talkabout painting. These conversations, therefore, remind one of dialogues betweenmutes—they smack their lips, ﬂail their arms, bare their teeth. . . . ‘‘What do youmean, you don’t understand that blot?’’ . . . ‘‘In this is something . . . something . . .something like, you know, well . . .’’ ‘‘Lovely, lovely, by golly . . . dog damn it!’’ . . .‘‘Brilliant, on my word!’’Why do they talk if they are only supposed to paint? After all, the language326Volume 2of the best works on the subject of the plastic arts is not much richer. And that muteblather continues among people . . . it goes on. . . . I don’t like these . . . I met an Austrian at Pocz Oddone’s. An architect. He clamors for urbanplanning and rationally aesthetic, functional interiors, etc. I told him that peoplehad more important concerns than aesthetics. I also said that an excessively subtlesense of beauty could get us into deep trouble! To explain to an average member ofthe middle class that his mirrored dresser, commode, and little curtains are frip-pery would make life altogether repugnant to him. We, in our poverty, could use amore universal skill—the discovery of beauty in everything, even in frippery.He didn’t understand me. Conceited. European. Didactic. Educated.Modern. Architect.

Wednesday
The weather wheels into dirty inclemency, the clouds, not certain whetherthey will rain or not, creep out of the sky; occasionally the sun shoots out, il-luminating the beach, where gold, blue, and white dance before my eyes. On thesand: games, jokes, capers—but bitterly, terribly paid for because these people haveto undress! Incredible cynicism! Their play is an act of desperate shamelessness,yes, they dared to do this . . . they undressed . . . they removed their shoes, socks,stockings, underpants, ties, shirts, blouses, jackets . . . and heigh-ho! . . . fraternizingwith nature, they frolic in their birthday suits! But this nudist is not naked, he isundressed! What impudence! Yes, yes, the wife of that pharmacist, look at her, shedigs into the sand with her feet, her heel, denuded, rises, crawls out—and the headof the sales department cuts capers, kicks a balloon, wheezes, cries out! Ha, whole-heartedly! Naked! But in an undressed, stripped nakedness! And an undressedboss! The pharmacist’s wife without underpants! And the toes strangely comple-ment the ﬁngers! And the whole beach roars with the mad provocation of carnalrepugnance. God, allow me to vomit up the human body! A dog appeared. Anunblemished dog who passed with canine elegance—distinguished. . . .I watched this from a little hill, and with me was Atilio, a sophisticated1958327expert on Mexican art. He said: Lovely little scene. There is a little Turner in this,isn’t there?Oh sure—a lovely scene, made up of horrors.
Thursday
Piñera claims that every crazy aesthete who has respect for himself inHavana must have an ‘‘antiquity’’—a clock from the epoch of Louis XIV, ora medallion—which he wouldn’t part with, bestowing on it the enthusiasm hewould have had for cathedrals, museums, and all the old things of Europe ingeneral if fate had allowed him a pilgrimage to Europe. As it turns out, Atilio, whois Mexican, also has his antiquity. Yesterday he removed a silver cup from asplendid leather case and showed it to me with reverence.—Authentic!Well, perhaps. . . . This was a furiously Renaissance cup of imposing propor-tions, full of some sort of sculpted scenes in every millimeter—a thicket of incredibleﬁgures, ornaments—to unravel this, to penetrate the many years of the artist’s work,one would have to devote hours to methodical analysis. I doubt that any one of itspossessors had ever taken the time to do this—it was unlikely that the cup had everreally been ‘‘examined’’ by anyone, ever. As for me, I limited myself to the pronounce-ment, from a bird’s-eye view, that the work seemed good . . . afterward I rememberedmy mother’s old china, parading in rows on shelves and also full of ﬁne points neveruncovered by anyone. It was enough that the porcelain was authentic. . . .After caressing the cup lasciviously (whereby he also embraced the effort ofpast centuries) and casting a synthetic look at it (for all the world like the one weused to cast at our porcelains), Atilio put it back in the case. And he took a stack of artbooks out of his suitcase.—I always take these books with me, he said.—I wouldn’t beable to live without them! These were books about the cathedral at Chartres, aboutPicasso, Michelangelo, Etruscan vases, Giotto’s frescoes, and the Greek temples.—Ah!—exclaimed Atilio, turning the pages.—Ah, have a look at these, Mr. Gombro-wicz, here . . . here . . . And here!? Really? I glanced, then he glanced, but this wasmore like bathing in an ocean . . . knots of form washed over us, like waves; we weredrowned and lost in it. Chartres knocked me over like a mountain of water. Howmany months, years, would it take to know a cathedral that was, from top to bottom,328Volume 2all the way to the arches in the nave, rock that had been worked over, tormented,saturated with passion, humanized—as if entire swarms of workers had thrownthemselves on the rock, like waves. How could one onlooker absorb the effort of somany artists? And Giotto and Picasso and Michelangelo were already waiting inambush, as we ﬂipped through the illustrations of the cathedral.—Ha!—Atiliotossed—Ha! Splendid!—We were drowning. We were drowning in this like in a storewith too many luxuries; like children hunting butterﬂies, we kept grabbing at thisline, that spot, pale testimony to what was eluding us. . . .We did not see much . . . instead we conducted an inventory . . . like a miserwho passes pieces of gold from hand to hand, we sated ourselves on these riches,practically without looking . . . trusting that someone must exist, after all, who has examined these things. Take this Giotto fresco. I cannot devote too much time toit, but I trust, I trust, that someone else has, has examined it. . . . Here, however, Iwas surprised by a deadly thought: what if that someone else did not exist? Andwhat if each person shifts this burden of examining onto another person and what ifthis delight is passed from hand to hand, pushing it into nothingness? Atilioshrugged his shoulders:—Pshaw! You say this to me, Mr. Gombrowicz. Why, I’ve invested half mylife in art. . . .He lied. Apparently he never did anything except casually leaf through thisoversized book of plastic arts. He merely leafed through it . . . occasionally glancinghere and there . . . pecking at it like a chicken. . . . But how could anyone prove hewas lying?
Friday
Senora Mercedes H. de A. has come all the way from Buenos Aires expresslyto see Atilio’s cup (Atilio is not returning to Buenos Aires, he is going to Chile)—thislady is skinny, hermetic, voiceless, and she took the cup into her hand, looked at it, putit down and whispered: Ah-h-h.—I would never have forgiven myself if I had allowedyou to leave Argentina without my having seen the cup!—After a brief pause, shewhispered:—I would also like to know what you think about Pettoruti, about his lastcolor? Atilio grimaced:—I preferred him from ﬁve years ago.—We agree then!—shecried out almost inaudibly, pleased. She got into her car and drove off.1958329As I watched the enormous car carry off Madame Mercedes, I thought ofthat Polish girl, the blonde, a young painter whom I met when she showed up herefrom Poland via Paris, a few years ago. She had no car. She spent a few months inArgentina, running from exhibit to exhibit. From painter to painter. Industrious.No, that one would not waste a single minute. Focused. Panting with the desire toenrich her painter’s estate. Like a pointer snifﬁng out ‘‘values.’’ Never speaking ofanything else. Copying, sketching, writing down, planted ﬁrmly in the problems ofthe plastic arts and constantly, without a moment’s respite, educating herself sin-cerely, modestly, diligently. There is nothing more irritating than her greedy andpious, her poltroonish industry.At least Mercedes . . . I don’t know which is worse: that exhausting, pro-letarian avidity, vehement in its ‘‘self-education,’’ or the pluto-aristocratic gesture ofthe rich lady who, having driven four hundred kilometers to see a cup, barelydevotes one careless glance to it—but why should she have looked at it; it wasenough that she, Mercedes, paid it a visit! Art objects are exasperating because theyare so material, and yet they are also the church and the drawing room, art andjewelry. . . . At the hotel I found Jerzy Rohde’s diary—he is the secretary to theArgentine embassy in Paris and a writer—entitled Five Years of Paris. ‘‘Cuantasexpresiones del arte, hijas del supremo buen gusto!’’ (How many works of art areborn of the most distinguished taste!) This blissful exclamation point gracedhis enraptured lips at the sight of Gobelins, Clodion’s bronzes, Roettier’s silver,Fragonard’s paintings, and other miracles of the ennobled French Jew Monsieurde Comondo at his Parisian residence, a copy of the Petit Trianon. Mr. Rohdeadmires both works and duquesas but the duquesas a little more. (Loli Lariviere—laencantandora—me lleva al salón de la duquesa de La Rochefoucauld . . .) I havestudied about ﬁfty pages and am beginning seriously to wonder whether our attrac-tion to old Fragonard and to the old Duchess de La Rochefoucauld does not springfrom the same source—from the intoxicating word ‘‘aristocracy.’’
Saturday
Not long ago at a banquet in honor of Racquel Forner (in my opinion, amannered and bad Argentinean painter) and her husband, the sculptor Bigatti(because having snagged some award or other, they were leaving for the States), I330Volume 2saw them, painters, an entire body of them, talking, lashing each other withdiscourse, having a holiday. I observed this from the sidelines, from another tablein the same restaurant. ‘‘One can only wonder,’’ as people say. It is indeed strangeto see how a mechanism of degradation becomes one of elevation in such circum-stances. Each of these painters secretly scorned his colleagues because, well, anArgentinean brush is nothing compared with a Parisian brush—yet here, at thebanquet, all together, afﬁrming mutual honors, they became quite a lion, al-together in one heap they became a paean to their own honor; and their table rangwith praise, their table seemed momentous, even appealing, because of the num-ber of persons participating in the act of self-elevation.That it did not last long is another matter. Shortly, their peacock tail closedup and a more workmanlike atmosphere got the upper hand. The conversationfocused itself on exhibits, awards, the sale of paintings—they were like owners ofcompanies, worrying about their little factory, prudent and a little embittered, fullof ill-feeling toward society, which is ignorant, does not want to buy. . . . They areusually anarchists . . . sometimes Communists, but in fact they are inextricablybound up with the bourgeoisie. Only a bourgeois could afford what appeals tothem—beautiful interiors, Renaissance cups, valuable antiques, the reﬁnement—all this is a denial of mass production, that is, proletarian production. And nomatter what is said and done, their valuable objects exist only for someone topossess, to materially possess, so they become someone’s property—possessing inthis art means a lot and it cannot take place without private capital.
Sunday
I spoke about England with Mrs. Kropka Czerwi ´ nska. Now I am at the beach, among bodies, and I write, lying on my stomach. Iwonder . . . I wonder if my rebellion against the plastic arts did not begin with myportraits. . . . I posed for artists a few times and I was always troubled by it because ofthat stranger’s eyes moving all over my form, because of my being sacriﬁced tothose alert eyes, intent, almost excessively observant . . . and he there, behind theeasel, making of me whatever he liked. A highly abnormal situation in which oneshould expect a great deal—in a creative-artistic sense. . . . But even during thesitting I had the impression that the painter’s advantage over me was illusory—1958331simply because he was unable to master my form, and the technical difﬁcultiesconnected with re-creating my nose, ears, cheeks on the canvas make a diligentcraftsman out of him rather than the lord and ruler of my body. And as the workprogressed, the combination of lines and blots re-creating a form became moreand more complex—the more he transferred me to the canvas, the more I lorded itover him, the more difﬁcult it became for him to change something in this ar-rangement, ‘‘to do something’’ with me, to remake me. I assume that if a cliff ortree could feel something, they would experience exactly these kinds of trium-phantly ironic feelings toward the painter attacking them with his paintbrush,feelings, I would say, of triumphant powerlessness, which resulted from the paint-er’s surrender to form in order to grasp it—and at the very moment that he graspsform and transfers it to the canvas, he will no longer be able to manage it becausethis very same ‘‘thing’’ rules the painting and rivets us with its relentless thingness.It seemed to me as well that the humiliating physicality of process, that oily re-creation of the nose, ears, eyes, hair, that melancholy sensuality, surrendering tonature, deprives the painter of the capacity to create, and in each case the marginearmarked for creativity becomes, in proportion to my becoming concrete in thepainting, more and more narrow and insigniﬁcant. And then the portrait wasready. It was shown to me. Disenchantment!What happened?! He turned me into a thing! He painted me exactly as if Iwere a rock, ha! and now I see that he paints human beings the same way he doesother objects. And so what if his eyes missed me! . . . He painted me as if it were notI but my shoe that was important!
Tuesday
I met a band of misshapen nudists—sensually bearded or at least hairy . . .near the Quequen; they were helping the ﬁshermen draw in their nets. I felt myselfrecoil. I can’t stand their bohemianism in glasses and a beard, their slovenly buturban corporeality, that artistic ‘‘simplicity’’ combined with reﬁnement. . . . But Iwent up to them, greeted them and said (as always when they get in my way): Idon’t believe in painting (no credo en la pintura)!They answered by exploding with laughter.I said: Let us imagine that one of you had painted this ﬁsherman. What do332Volume 2you think, would I be able to judge the art of a painting if I were deprived of a senseof color, of form, and if my taste were not adequately informed? In other words, if Icould not look freshly, with a painter’s eye?They: Of course not! In that case you wouldn’t get anything out of thepainting!I: Really? But if I am able to do all that, why would I need a painting?They: What do you mean?I: Well, yes! If I am capable of seeing, I prefer to look at the living face of aﬁsherman. Instead of one painting, I’ll have ten, because that face is always dif-ferent, I see it from a different angle, in a different light. If I can extract the paintingvalue from a living face, why would I need the immobile one in your painting?And if I am unable to do that, your picture will tell me nothing interesting.Should I cast off the dazzling whirl of form, light, color that is the world foryour lifeless kingdom where nothing moves! Don’t you see how I want to get atyou? . . . I simply want to say that your brush is incapable of rendering the plasticityof the world. For the world is form in motion. Even when the form is still, the lightand air change. But you, on your canvases, condemn nature to paralysis by takingthe life from its form: by subtracting movement.They: What? What? Painting does not express movement? Absurd! Move-ment in a painting, even though it is suspended, frozen, is still movement—it ismovement even more precisely for that reason!I: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!Lies! Ah, how I love these typical lies about art, always ready to prove itsweaknesses are its strength!Yes, just between us . . . No one is listening . . . Yes, privately . . . Admit thatif you could bring this divine quickening movement to your palette, you would bein paradise.Why not confess that a paintbrush is a clumsy instrument? . . . It’s as if youtook to painting explosions of cosmic light with a toothbrush.No art is so poor in its means of expression—except perhaps sculpture.Painting is one great resignation from what cannot be painted. It is a cry: I wouldlike to do more, but I cannot. This cry is oppressive.Would you like to hear a short tale about your bankruptcy?Formerly painters strove for the most faithful rendering of nature. But why1958333re-create something that already is? And besides, isn’t this condemning oneself towork that is eternally slipshod? Nature paints better. No Titian can paint theﬁsherman’s face with equal excellence—error is impossible, every shadow, everyspot is exactly as physics dictates.Not being able, therefore, to match nature, one begins to rescue oneself byway of the ‘‘spirit.’’ More and more human spirit is crammed into a painting. At thispoint, however, the sensuality of painting, antispiritual in its very essence, crawlsout. What should one do with the spirit when one deals almost exclusively withmatter? Pump it into a painting as sublime content—as anecdote? . . . But this spiritwould then be somewhat comic, an afterthought!Then it became more and more clear that the painter was not supposed toexpress external nature or the spirit but his view of nature . . . that is, himself,without transgressing the limits of his own physical sphere . . . to express himselfwith purely a painter’s means, contour, color. . . . Thus began the deformation ofthe object. But how is one to express himself in a painting deprived of movement?For existence is movement, it takes place in time. How can I pass myself on, or myexistence, operating only with combinations of immobile shapes? Life is move-ment. If I cannot render movement, I cannot render life. Notice that I am thinkingof real movement, not the suggestion of movement that a painter gives us insketching, for example, a jumping horse. Compare, in this regard, line and colorwith the word. The word unfolds in time, like a procession of ants, and each onebrings something new and unexpected; he who expresses himself in words is bornanew each second; scarcely has one sentence been completed than the next onesupplements it, completes it, and behold in the movement of words the endlessplay of my existence expresses itself—when I express myself in words, I am like atree in the wind, rustling, quivering. And the painter is chucked out in one shot, allin space, immobile on the canvas—like a clod. We take in the entire picture at aglance. And so what if we notice a certain play of elements in the painting, if theplay does not develop or unfold? Painting can undoubtedly communicate thevision of the painter, his spiritual adventure with the world, but only in the cross-section of one moment—and for me to be able to penetrate his personality, I wouldhave to have a thousand such visions; only they, all together, would be capable ofintroducing me to his inner movement, his life, his time.What deception to claim that van Gogh or Cézanne communicated their334Volume 2personalities! To paint apples a little differently from natural ones—and to want torival the airborne becoming of poetry and music with these apples . . . A manexpressed by an apple! An unmoving apple! If I, a writer and poet, were told that Ishould communicate via apples, I would sit down and cry in humiliation. But if weare talking about art and its masters, we are visited by a certain indulgence . . .sympathy, and even adoration, lead us to overlook some triﬂing and some not-so-triﬂing inaccuracies, just so we do not upset the status quo . . . how ready we arethen to swear that it was apples or sunﬂowers that led us to Cézanne or van Gogh,but we forget that if they became our close acquaintances it was because biogra-phies ﬁlled in the enormous gap left by the sunﬂowers and the apples. If the wordhad not conveyed their lives to us, there’s not much we could do with their self-portraits.Painting, then, even though it was already deforming, continued to sufferchronic insatiety—those martyrs of the paintbrush (that clumsy instrument) feltthat they could not express themselves on a larger scale by imitating existing formsin nature, even if they underwent an extreme transformation. What were they todo? How were they to liberate themselves from the Thing; the Thing to which theywere chained like dogs? Wouldn’t it be possible—to destroy the Thing, take it apartand create one’s own language out of this—an autonomous language? That is howabstract art began. But so what if it does not move either or, strictly speaking, iscongealed movement. In music pure form is attainable, because music is a becom-ing—after the pianissimo of the violin comes a stroke of percussion, here formrenews itself every minute—but an abstract painting is like one chord . . . it is as if amusician invited someone to concert and then offered him just one chord. Ab-straction has taken away from painting the imitation of life that it had when it wasimitation of nature—and did not give it another vitality in exchange.To hell with your painting! I have had enough of it! Enough of this mania!They: Listen, mister! You are insensitive! Ignorant! You understand noth-ing! You don’t get it!I: Look at these three matches I put down on the sand.Imagine that in a certain group of people there arises a stubborn rivalry onthe subject of how to arrange these three matches so that they would be morerevealing artistically. If I make a triangle of them, for example, they will be more1958335interesting than if I place them side by side. But one can devise even moreinteresting arrangements.Let us imagine that the great effort of many ﬁne ‘‘matchists’’ becameinvested in this; that some turned out to be more, others less, ingenious; thathierarchies arose; that schools and styles emerged; that there arose an expertise onthe subject. . . . But, I ask you, why would this be absurd? Why, even with just thosethree matches man could express something—about himself, about the world. . . .By concentrating all of our attention on these three matchsticks, we could uncoverthe mystery of the cosmos in them—they are a part of it and one knows that theuniverse is reﬂected in a drop of water—nevertheless they are no more and no lessthan a Thing in all its majesty—for in their behavior the laws of nature expressthemselves—for in looking at these matches with the appropriate concentration weperform a solemn act, we confront consciousness with Matter.All of this—under the condition that we begin to look closely at them. Thequestion remains—is it worth it, is it worth it, is it worth it? We could use treesrather than matches or animals or anything else just as successfully and with evenbetter results for this initiation.And I don’t deny that if we begin to look with such concentration atCézanne, Cézanne will become a revelation. The question remains—is it worth it,is it worth it, is it worth it? Why not seek these revelations elsewhere?In my opinion, you err in thinking that the paintings themselves are some-thing of a revelation and that is why people look at them. In my opinion, just theopposite has happened. Paintings have become revelations because people havebegun to search for revelations in them—that is why the offensive poverty of this arthas burst into profundity and riches.Why then has mankind begun to look closely at paintings?You will ﬁnd answers to this in the mechanisms of human cohabitation, inits historical development. Painting, in spite of everything, is pretty, right? It servesto ornament. Hence a market for paintings has arisen, just as it has for jewelry.People began to pay because—to paraphrase Pascal—if a Titian hangs on my wall itmeans that I am somebody, because I am rich. This pretty object—a painting—hasthereby inﬂamed the possessive instinct in kings, dukes, bishops, all the way to thebourgeoisie, and the need has created a whole scale of values. There are many336Volume 2reasons for this; people, just like individuals, have their games and manias. . . .Who, for example, could have foreseen that a certain type of stone, such as adiamond or ruby (whose artistic effect is minimal), would arouse such powerfuldesires in man? And what about postage stamps?Of course, a painting is not a postage stamp. It is, however, art, althoughquite limited in its means of expression. Combine the artistic charge of a paintingwith other powers, not having much in common with art, and you will understandwhy it has been raised so high by our feelings, almost to the level of holiness.The only question is—is painting worth keeping at these heights?Today this is what happens to you: ﬁrst the complicated herd instinct,which creates itself historically, throws you on your knees before a painting—andonly then do you try to force yourselves to explain that if you reeled with admira-tion, it was because the work was worthy of it.Is it worth surrendering oneself to such intricate games with one’s ownfeelings?Stop becoming enraptured—that’s a lot simpler.

(Everything I have reproached them with is quite arbitrary. And does notexhaust the subject. One could attack them from a different angle—from tendifferent angles—their Achilles’ heels number in the dozens.But my purpose is not to explain but to revolt. I wish to protest! I believethat others will follow me. Providence, allow me to endure a few more years in theopposition—it will ﬁnd its own.To derail enthusiasm, which moves along a well-worn track!My war with painting, like my war with poetry, is primarily a struggle withthe milieu—painters, poets—with the group, with the profession. . . . Never beforehas the law borne itself out more truly than it does here: the conditions of produc-tion create the Spirit in its own image—nothing better illustrates Marx’s thesis thanthe awful artistic mystiﬁcation, which they, Marxists, do not dare touch. Painters,poets, their zealots and acolytes, are a typical example of an accommodatingconsciousness—they not only believe, they want to believe. My reproach is thattheir faith comes to them too easily, even too eagerly—maniacs, exploiting for theirartiﬁcial passion a certain artiﬁcial state of things, created by historical circum-1958337stance. And not a single one wants to sober up. Each one does his utmost to drownin his mania. And they want to drown me in it, too. I will defend myself!)
Saturday
I showed them the matches. Too bad that I neglected to show them acigarette.Doesn’t a cigarette provide us with great pleasure? Almost as great as eat-ing? Who, though, would dare compare bread to cigarettes? Bread is a genuinenecessity but a cigarette became a value only when an artiﬁcial need was born,created by habit.Therefore, don’t be so proud that today’s humanity inhales with suchpleasure the fragrant incense rising from art exhibits. I do not doubt man’s inbornneed for beauty. But I ask whether in certain types of art (such as a poem orpainting) the producer does not fabricate his recipient as well.This pressure, this forcing of paintings onto people—this is something tothink about!
Friday
From my letter to Artur Sandauer in connection with Mr. Kisiel’s article inPoland’s Tygodnik Powszechny, whose title was: ‘‘Sandauer and Gombrowicz, orthe Conspiracy of the Absent.’’
In reading the passage from your essay that was cited and attacked by him, Ithought how incapable he is of reading us, neither you, nor me, how he under-stands nothing of our work. I am completely unfamiliar with your essay exceptfor the passage included by Kisiel—I haven’t the least idea what you wrote, but,in spite of this, allow me, my dear Sandauer, to say how your words should beinterpreted from my vantage point.Here they are as cited by Kisiel:‘‘Something has arisen which is a complete novelty in Polish literature: self-irony, self-denigration. In laughing at himself and sneering at the gamut of Pol-ish issues, Gombrowicz rids himself of that self-importance and solemnity that338Volume 2for many long years has been a feature of our culture; thus he seems to presentthe perspective of creating a more authentic, more national, culture. . . .’’It was this that roused Kisiel—and he explains triumphantly in his article thatyour ‘‘novum’’ is really nihil novi, that our literature, beginning with the bards,*has been full of this ‘‘self-irony and self-denigration.’’ ‘‘This has been a basictradition and convention of Polish literature for the past 150 years,’’ he writes.But he writes this because he does not understand what you are tryingto say. Kisiel maintains that in The Wedding Wyspia ´ nski denigrates himself and practices self-irony. In fact—nothing could be further from the truth. TheWedding does, perhaps, compromise the Polish nation, but he himself, Wyspi-a´nski, is the highest judge here; and it is he who casts thunderbolts and tears athis robes. The Wedding does not, therefore, compromise Wyspia ´ nski, just as thethunderbolts, curses, and sneers aimed at the nation beginning with S™owackiand Norwid, Bobrzy ´ nski or Brzozowski and ending with Nowaczy ´ nski, havenothing to do with self-denigration.In writing ‘‘self-denigrating’’ didn’t you have in mind that in Ferdy-durke I accepted a posture that was quite unexpected, proclaiming my ownimmaturity and accusing other authors of hiding theirs? Wouldn’t this constitutea certain ‘‘novum’’ in our writing? And even in all writing? And here one canspeak about ‘‘self-denigration,’’ under the condition, of course, that this con-fession of immaturity will not serve merely as a polemical stratagem or humorouseffect. What sort of dialogue would have erupted between Wyspia ´ nski andmyself if we could have met for coffee at a café? He:—I grieve over the shortcom-ings of the Polish nation because I am more mature than the Polish nation. I:—Idon’t bemoan the Polish nation at all; I bewail only my own immaturity and thenation concerns me only as one of the components of my immaturity. I, therefore,lock horns with the nation, just as I lock horns with every other phenomenon thatobstructs or negates the possibility of maturity; which does not mean that I ammore mature than my fellow Poles, no, I am simply more aware of my immaturityand this allows me a little distance; but I also confess that this immaturityfascinates, beguiles, and ﬁlls me with delight. For I am at one and the same timea mature Immaturity and an immature Maturity. . . .Let us forget about the last sentence, perhaps it is too difﬁcult for
*Polish Romantic poets, chieﬂy Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz S™owacki.1958339persons unaccustomed to this kind of thinking. . . . But one can see from theabove that my ‘‘criticism’’ of the nation has nothing in common with traditionalcriticism in our literature; that it is based on a different self-image, differentvision, different theory. And that it is not really criticism, but a battle for mypsychological existence and a battle for the form that delineates this existence—a battle in which I, an individual, grapple with the milieu not in the name of ahigher, objective, purpose, but in the name of my own purpose.And now, if you go on to write that I am ‘‘sneering at the gamut ofPolish issues’’—how am I to understand this? Certainly not in the way thatKisiel understood it, that I am sneering at what is clumsy about them, butinstead that I condemn them as a whole, with their good and bad sides, becausethey are ‘‘off the subject,’’ because they are concerned with the existence anddevelopment of the nation and not with the existence and development of thepeople who make up the nation. Because these Polish issues revolve around thecollectivity, while I insist on the problem of the individual. Because they areissues above our station and stature, the work of an artiﬁcial maturity thatmakes one person more of a patriot than he really is in the presence of others—which has nothing to do with our authentic psychic life. And it would be good ifKisiel ﬁnally understood that the course of my revolutionary and rare thesis isthis simple truth: an individual is something more fundamental than a nation.The individual takes precedence over the nation.But, Mr. Sandauer, how should one interpret your words that here is‘‘the perspective of creating a more authentic, more national, culture’’? Is it notbecause the Pole has more reasons than a Frenchman or an Englishman not toidentify himself with his national form (something which Kisiel does not grasp);and that this greater distance from form could ensure us an altogether originalcontribution to European culture? Imagine the shock—if the proud ‘‘I am aFrenchman’’ of a Frenchman and the ‘‘I am an Englishman’’ of the English-man met with the Polish, unexpected ‘‘I am not wholly a Pole, I am above beinga Pole. . . .’’Have I explained your intentions well? I repeat, I am not familiar withyour lecture, I do not know the context of these words and whether you usedthem in a narrower sense—but I intentionally applied the broadest, deepestmeaning to them to show that these few lines could be interpreted in whateverway the soul desired; superﬁcially, like Kisiel, or a little more profoundly. It is340Volume 2possible to drown these two sentences in our immortal banality—load themwith all the platitudes, slogans, schemas, perversions, and mannerisms of Po-lish national thought—or one can ﬁnd fresher contents. Except that, in thesecond case, one must have some concept of the ideas forming the skeletonbeneath the living ﬂesh of my books. . . . one must know something about formand immaturity. . . . But is it worth demanding so awesome an intellectualeffort from Kisiel, who, being a Sarmatian,* is not a philosopher and whosehighest philosophical efforts express maxims like: ‘‘Poor souls, these egocentrics.Can an egocentric be a prophet? Maybe, but a false one.’’ Just as for that otherconnoisseur, Mr. Sakowski of London’s Wiadomo´ sci, at whose mercy I live here, in emigration, my Diary is rife with nonsense, which he, Sakowski, cannotcomprehend for all the world and is forced to attribute to a strange pose or to astupid craving for originality, so for Kisiel my treatment of Poland is yesterday’sreheated leftover—a peculiar thing in an author to whom he otherwise at-tributes a sizable dose of innovation. The conclusions of these two gentlemensound so strange because their expertise has blinded them to what every intel-ligent reader notices—that my views make up an organic whole, that my atti-tude to art or to the nation, or to other similar matters, is simply the branchingof a tree whose root is my concept of form. Yes—but Poles don’t like to get downto the roots, Mr. Sakowski or Kisiel are instead ‘‘social’’ beings, far from boringthemselves or others with thinking that is too rigorous. After all, what’s theCatholic Church for? The Church will, once again, absolve Kisiel of the dis-agreeable task of rigorous thinking.One more little word. I smiled when I read the following passage inKisiel’s article:‘‘That which is universal and creative in Gombrowicz ensures him a place inthe history of literature without regard for the anachronisms of the thirties.On the other hand, Gombrowicz is not suited to be a leader of intellectuallife in Poland today: his judgments about this life are as dogmatic as they arenaive and outdated. Sandauer has elevated him to the role of leader, and afew young people are inclining in his direction. . . .’’
*Term often applied to Polish country squires to designate their provincial, undereducated,but extremely self-satisﬁed posture.1958341Now what’s this? Is Kisiel letting the cat out of the bag?Let him relax . . . his fears are groundless. . . .I really believe that from here, from America, I see Poland a lot betterthan Kisiel, who is embedded in it, like a potato in a sack of potatoes . . . whosedialectics smell a bit musty, who thinks in clichés culled from Polish litera-ture; who, furthermore, is unbalanced, provincially unbalanced, chaﬁng from asense of Polish inferiority only to elevate himself a moment later with that Polish‘‘nevertheless’’ megalomania (‘‘the conﬂict of two ideas, animating millions ofpeople in Europe and directing general attention to Poland’’). Yes, I deﬁnitelysee this better from here, from the world, and more soberly, and I think about itmuch more freely. But—never fear—I am not thinking of being a ‘‘leader’’ ofany sort. I—a leader? Why, I don’t even aspire to the title of ‘‘Polish writer.’’ Isimply want to be Gombrowicz, nothing more.

Wednesday, Tandil
I arrived in Tandil a few days ago and took a room at the Hotel Continental.Tandil is a city—surrounded by low hills bristling with rock, like fortresses—ofseventy thousand inhabitants and I have come because it is spring and to get rid ofthe last microbes of an Asian ﬂu.Yesterday I rented, for a reasonable rate, a lovely apartment somewhat onthe outskirts of town, in the foothills, where there is a great stone gate and a parkjoins a mountain forest of conifers and eucalyptus.Through the window, opened wide onto the dazzling sun of the morning, Isee Tandil in the hollow, as if on a platter—this little house ﬂoats in a gentle cas-cade of palm and orange trees, pines, eucalyptus, wisteria, multitudes of trimmedshrubs and the strangest cacti tumbling toward the city while in the background ahigh wall of dark pines climbs almost vertically toward the peak, on which stands aconfectionary castle. There is nothing more ﬂoral or springlike, more blossomingor radiant. And the mountains surrounding the city—dry as pepper dust, bare,rocky, and jutting out in enormous boulders—have the appearance of pedestals,prehistoric bastions, platforms, and ruins. An amphitheater.Before me Tandil: three hundred meters away yet as clear as if it were in the342Volume 2palm of my hand. It is by no means a health resort with hotels and tourists but anordinary provincial city. Brushing my teeth in the sun and inhaling the fragrance ofblossoms, I considered ways of ‘‘penetrating’’ the city I was warned against: ‘‘Youwill be bored to death in Tandil.’’I ate a marvelous breakfast in a small café suspended over gardens—ah,nothing much, coffee and two eggs but awash in blossoming!—after which I en-tered the city and its squares, the rectangles of blinding white houses with ﬂat roofs,sharp angles, drying laundry, and under a wall—a motorcycle and a large, ﬂatsquare exploding with greenery. One walks in the hot sun and the cool air ofspring. People. Faces. One and the same face, walking in pursuit of something,running some errand or other, preoccupied, unhurried, kind, calm. . . . ‘‘You willbe bored to death in Tandil!’’I looked at the sign on one of the buildings: ‘‘Nueva Era, Daily.’’ I walkedin. I introduced myself to the editor but didn’t feel like chatting, I was somewhatdrowsy, dreamy-eyed, and because of all this I answered him badly. I said I was un escritor extranjero and asked if anyone intelligent lived in Tandil, someone worthgetting to know.—What?—retorted the editor, offended.—We do not lack intelligent peo-ple. Our cultural life is rich, there are seventy painters alone! Writers? Well, wehave Cortes; he is a big name, he publishes in the press of the capital. . . .We called Cortes and arranged a meeting for the next day. I spent the rest ofthe day wandering the streets of Tandil. A corner. On the corner stands the plump,behatted owner of something or other next to two soldiers, farther down a womanin her seventh month and a wagon with delicacies—whose vendor sleeps blissfullyon a bench, covered with a newspaper. And a loudspeaker sings: ‘‘You have im-prisoned me in your dark eyes. . . .’’ I sing to myself: ‘‘You will be bored to death inTandil.’’ A weather-beaten gentleman in boots and a cap.
Thursday
From here, from the mountain, Tandil looks surrounded by prehistory—shattered mountains of rock. I ate a delightful breakfast in the sun, trees, ﬂowers.But I feel uncertain, alien, this unknown life is bothering me. . . . I go to the‘‘Centro Popular,’’ where I had agreed to meet Cortes. This is a sizable library of1958343about twenty thousand volumes—deep within is a small room in which some sortof arts and culture committee is meeting. As I walk in, the session is adjourning andCortes introduces me to those gathered. After ﬁve minutes of conversation, I getthe picture: Cortes, a Communist-idealist, dreamer, upstanding, full of good inten-tions, well-wishing, decent—that ﬁfteen year old is not a girl but the wife (in hertwenties) of that young man over there, also an idealist made sublime by Marx.The secretary, on the other hand, is a Catholic, and a third man, who looks likeRembrandt, is a militant Catholic. They are united by faith.They have never heard of me. What did I expect—this is a backwater. But Ibecome cautious. I know immediately what tactics to use in these circumstancesand I do not make the mistake of introducing myself; on the contrary, I act as if Iwere well known and I merely give them a hint of my Europe through my tone, myform—this manner of speaking must be piquant, careless, unceremonious, with adash of intellectual chic. Paris. This grabbed them. They say: Ah, you’ve been toParis! I, casually:—Well, yes, it’s a city just like Tandil, houses, streets, a café on thestreet corner, all cities are the same. . . . They like this. That I did not pride myself onParis but instead denigrated it resulted in their seeing the Parisian in me; I see thatCortes is almost won over and the ladies are interested but still a little suspicious.Nevertheless . . . they demonstrate a lack of attention—some sort of absent-mindedness—as if they were consumed by something else—and suddenly I beginto understand that even if Camus and Sartre themselves were to show up in Tandil,these people would be incapable of overcoming their stubborn inattentiveness,their thinking about something local, about something Tandilian. But what’s this?Suddenly they become animated: they begin to talk, interrupting one another.About what? About their affairs, about the fact that almost no one came to the lastlecture, that they have to force people to come, that Fulano does come but that heimmediately falls asleep, that the doctor’s wife has taken offense. . . . They talk as ifthey were talking to me, but it is really among themselves that they lament, groan,certain of my writer’s approval, that I, as a writer, will share in full their bit-ter sorrow over their ‘‘grass-roots work,’’ all of that Tandilian ˙Zeromszczyzna.* Br-r-r- . . . ‘‘You will be bored to death in Tandil.’’ Suddenly Tandil crashes over my
*After Stefan ˙Zeromski, Polish novelist of the Modernist period whose works often featuredcharacters sacriﬁcing their personal lives for the public good; here used pejoratively.344Volume 2brain, that rancid, unleavened, coarse content of a modest, limited life, behindwhich they, as behind a cow, boring and eternal, are made concrete for all time.—Let the people be!—I say.—But . . . —Where did you get the idea that everyone has to be intelligent andenlightened?—What?!—Leave the yokels alone!The word ‘‘yokel’’ (bruto) fell and what was worse, ‘‘populace’’ (vulgo)—atwhich I became aristocratic. It was as if I had declared war. I had torn away themask of convention.Now they became cautious.—You deny the necessity for universal enlightenment?—Of course.—But . . . —Away with teaching!This was too much. Cortes picked up his pen, looked at its tip under thelight, and blew.—We don’t understand one another—he said, as if he were worried.And a young man in the shadows muttered malevolently:—You’re probably a fascist, eh?
Friday
I had indeed said too much. It was unnecessary. Nevertheless, I feel better. . . that aggressiveness strengthened me.And what if they brand me a fascist? . . . That’s all I need! I have to talk toCortes—patch things up.
Saturday
What’s going on?Often a soul forms itself murkily, bluntly . . . from just any old series ofhaphazard incidents. The encounter with them in the library, well, it was nothingbut it acted like a catalyst. Now the roles are clearly distributed. I am an aristocrat. I1958345have been revealed to them as an aristocrat. I am an aristocrat in Tandil . . . whichat the same stroke came to embody common provincialism.One should understand, however, that this was the mere outline . . . themere outline of some sort of theater against the background of a million otherevents ﬁlling my day, events, which I cannot enumerate, events, in which theoutline of drama dissolves like sugar in tea—so much so that the shape is lost andonly the taste remains. . . .I write this after another conversation with Cortes which instead of patch-ing things up, aggravated the whole situation. I was irritated. I was irritated by theangelic sweetness of a Communist priest.I will not repeat the entire conversation. I told him that the idea of equalitycontradicts the entire structure of the human species. The thing that is mostsplendid in people, the thing that establishes their brilliance when compared withother species, is exactly that man is not equal to man—while an ant is equal toanother ant. These are the two great modern lies: the lie of the Church, that allhave the same soul; the lie of democracy, that everyone has an equal right to de-velopment. You think that these ideas are a triumph of the spirit? Not at all,they derive from the body, this view is founded chieﬂy on our all having the samebody.I do not deny (I continued) that the optical impression is not to be doubted:we are all more or less the same height and we have the same organs. . . . But thesoul, this speciﬁc characteristic of our species, intrudes on the uniformity of thispicture, and it causes our species to be so individuated, so precipitous and ver-tiginous, that between man and man arise differences a hundred times greater thanin all of the animal world. Between Pascal and Napoleon and a little villagepeasant there is a chasm greater than between a horse and a worm. What’s more, apeasant differs less from a horse than from Valéry or Saint Anselm. An illiterate anda professor are only superﬁcially the same people. A director is someone differentfrom a worker. Are you telling me that you don’t know that—intuitively speaking,in the margin of theory—our myths about equality, solidarity, and fraternity areincompatible with the real situation?I admit that I doubt whether in these conditions one can speak of the‘‘human’’ species—isn’t this a concept that is simply too physical?Cortes looked at me with the eye of a wounded intellectual. I knew what he346Volume 2was thinking: fascism! and I was going crazy with delight proclaiming this Declarationof Inequality, because for me intelligence was changing into harshness, into blood!
Tuesday
—Tilos—pinos—platanos—naranjos—palmeras—glicinas—mimbres—alamos—cipres—breakfast on the veranda of the café in this bouquet; in the distance,ancient amphitheaters and bastions, great piles of rubble, circuses gleaming with sun.I loaf and wander about Tandil. Their monotonous bustle—the deadeningpedestrianism of these comings and goings—their antlike thrift, their equine pa-tience, bovine languor, when I . . . when I . . . I cannot get to anyone because theyare drowned in their own world and their isolation is unfathomable, each chasesafter his own, theirs is the solitude of animals, horses, frogs, ﬁsh. They are deﬁnedby their routine tasks, nothing else. The whole city is one great big hustle andbustle. What should I do?! A la recherche du temps perdu —I ﬁnd this book in the library, I take Proust home and I read: I read in order to immerse myself in anelement that is more familiar to me, to be with my brother, Proust!
Wednesday
Is he really a member of the family? Yes—we are both from the samedistinguished family. We should embrace one another. A subtle work, sharp as ablade, vibrating, thin and hard—what a delightful counterpoint to this clumsy,heavy, massive, Tandil existence. We are both of the aristocracy—both reﬁned! Butno! To hell with him, he irritates me, disgusts me, I see too much of my owncaricature in him.He has always irritated me. I could never reconcile myself to the panegyricattached to him. This monster . . . reﬁnement due to suffocation, eternally stuffedinto bedclothes, overheated and sticky, enfeebled and mufﬂed, drowned in medici-nal compounds, condemned to all the dirt of the body, walled up in his cork-linedroom . . . my ordinary, Polish provinciality is revolted by his French decadence.One could admire and even adore the energy inspired from on high that decreedthat this life—swaddled in the folds of a maternal skirt, coddled; limited to bed,books, paintings, drawing-room conversations, snobberies—should give birth to a1958347work that is hard and cruel, touching on the most concealed nerves of reality. Onemight see the redeeming secret of the aristocracy in this transformation of softnessinto hardness, delicacy into acuity. One might even risk the statement that hissickness is transformed into health. Which is in keeping with the very essence ofart. In art it is not a healthy person who creates a healthy work or a strong personwho creates a strong work but quite the contrary: the sick man is better able to graspthe very essence of health, strength. . . . 
Noble health.No one knowsHow you tasteUntil you waste away.*
It is not odd, therefore, for him, a sick person, to have a keener sense ofhealth; for a person conﬁned to the four walls of a room to attain the most distanthorizons, and for artiﬁciality to lead him to splendid authenticity.But . . . What a shame! His compensation is incomplete. It is like anunderdone steak—on these pages I uncovered entire pieces of this half-cookedmeat, wretched, sick meat. . . .The ﬂaws of Proust’s book are enormous and innumerable—a gold mine ofdefects. His duel with Time, based on an exaggerated, naive faith in the power ofart—this is the professional mysticism of a crazed aesthete and artist. His psycho-logical analyses could drag out into inﬁnity, for they are only an embroidering onobservations—they are not exploratory, they lack a fundamental revelation of theworld, they have not come from a single penetrating look, they have not comefrom a vision, they are only the minutely detailed work of the (uninspired) intel-lect. His rich statements constantly rub up against mannerisms; it is almost impos-sible to determine when their sumptuous beauty tumbles into artiﬁcial effort. Hisbrand of metaphor betrays his weakness: it is not, in most cases, a metaphor thatreduces secondary phenomena to a more elementary form, but the reverse—it willalways tend to translate the great, elementary world into his own secondary reality,into the language of his ‘‘sphere,’’ to explain nature through a painting, not paint-ing through—nature. There is perversion in all this—an intentional lack of loyalty
*Fragment from a fraszka, or short occasional poem, by Polish Renaissance poet JanKochanowski.348Volume 2to life. As for the world that he has brought to life in his romance, there is nothingnarrower—his people are all of one mold, this is one family in which the sameinherited traits appear in various combinations—Charlus, Norpois, Madame deGuermantes, are cut from the same cloth, they all say basically the same thing.Monotony of plot characterizes a work with poor innovation and imagination, butappealingly diligent in cultivating detail. There is nothing that unmasks the ‘‘un-baked side’’ of Proust more than his intelligence—which can be wonderful—buthow often it also stumbles, who knows how and where, into helplessness, naïveté—these are the remnants of an unconquered naïveté, overreﬁnement, which has notbeen digested into knowledge but which has remained just that: overreﬁnement.Why do we admire him? We admire him, ﬁrst of all, because he dared to bedelicate and because he did not hesitate to show himself as he was—sometimes intails, sometimes in a bathrobe, accompanied by a bottle of medicine, a little bit ofhomosexual-hysterical lipstick, phobias, neuroses, weaknesses, snobbery, all themisery of a reﬁned Frenchman. We admire him because beyond that strange,tainted Proust we discover the nakedness of his humanity, the truth of his suffer-ings, and the power of his honesty. Too bad! If we look a little closer, again, beyondthe nakedness, we uncover Proust in a bathrobe, in tails, or in a nightshirt togetherwith all the accessories—the bed, medicines, bibelots. This is a game of hide-and-seek. No one knows what the ultimate is here: nakedness or costume, drawingroom or life, illness or health, hysteria or power. That is why Proust is a little ofeverything, profundity and shallowness, originality and banality, incisiveness andsimplicity . . . cynical and naive, elegant and unsavory, graceful and clumsy,amusing and boring, light and heavy. . . .Heavy! This cousin of mine crushes me. Because I do belong to the samefamily after all—I, the reﬁned . . . I am from the same milieu. Except without Paris.I did not have Paris. And coarse Tandil is trying its hardest to get at my delicate skin,unprotected by Parisian balm!
Thursday
Cortes suggested a young poet to me whose name was Juan Ángel Magari-nios, son of the owner of the Hotel Residencial. I asked him to invite a few otherpoets to the café.1958349At ﬁve o’clock, three boys showed up who hadn’t the slightest idea who Iwas and asked how I had found myself in Argentina. The fourth, a slight sixteenyear old, upon hearing my name, smiled and said: —Ferdydurke!They call him ‘‘Dipi.’’ So I now have two readers in Tandil (the other is theeighteen-year-old son of the museum director, Ferreir).They all write. —So I now have what I wanted: readers and a table of artistsin the café, colleagues. What a shame that not one of my colleagues is over twenty!

Cox is also a pal of mine. This thin, tall, seventeen-year-old bean pole whohas something of the bellhop about him—a familiar manner and easy knowledgeabout everything, the most perfect disregard I have ever encountered, an awfulworldliness, as if he had come to Tandil straight out of New York (yet he has nevereven set foot in Buenos Aires). Nothing appeals to him—his is a complete inabilityto feel any kind of hierarchy, a cynicism arising from his skill at maintaining po-lite appearances. This is wisdom born of a lower sphere—the wisdom of a streeturchin, newsboy, elevator or errand boy, for whom the ‘‘higher stratum’’ is worth asmuch as one can make off of it. Churchill, along with Picasso, Rockefeller, Stalin,Einstein, are nothing but big game peeled down to the last tip if they run into themin a hotel lobby. . . . This boy’s relationship to History calms me and even bringsme relief, it provides me with an equality that is more real than one composed ofslogans and theories. I relax.
Saturday
Life that is limited. Local life. One lives with whatever the new day brings.No one looks around, everyone looks at his feet, at his own path. Work. Family.Activity. To survive, somehow. . . . A concrete existence.This exhausts and attracts at the same time . . . oh, so these are the limita-tions I have craved! I am tired of the cosmos. I conﬁrm a crisis of ‘‘universalism’’ inmyself. I assume that many other people today also suffer from it. The diagnosis isas follows: century after century we expanded our horizons; our vision ﬁnallyencompassed the entire planet; we demand morality ‘‘for all,’’ rights ‘‘for all,’’350Volume 2everything ‘‘for everybody’’—and then it turns out that we are unequal to the task!Catastrophe! Disillusion! Bankruptcy! Why I have already made insects equal topeople in my desire for universal justice, the only one possible! But the blow dealtmy soul by the ﬁrst unrescued insect casts me into impotence . . . and nowpanequality, universal justice, universal love, all that is universal, are liquidatingthemselves in me—not because I want this to happen—but because I cannot helpit—after all, I am not Atlas lifting the whole world onto his shoulders!I, who not long ago was still angry at Catholics and Communists for theiraristocratic egotism toward animals, here with Cortes suddenly deny even peopleequality! How one thing contradicts another in me!Do I become the ‘‘reaction’’ then? To that entire process striving for univer-sality? I am so dialectic, so very prepared for the themes the epoch has stuffed mewith, for the bankruptcy of socialism, democracy, scientism, that out of sheerimpatience I look for unavoidable reaction, I myself am almost reaction!Narrow myself! Limit myself! To live only with what is mine! I want to beconcrete and private! I am sick of ideas that tell me to concern myself with China—I have not seen China, I don’t know China, I haven’t been there! Enough appealsto see my brother in a man who is not my brother! I want to lock myself within mycircle of vision and not reach further than I can see. I want to topple the accursed‘‘universality’’ that shackles me more than the most conﬁning prison and escapeinto the freedom of the limited!I record this desire, today, in Tandil.

In Tandil I am the most illustrious of men! No one equals me here! Thereare seventy thousand of them—seventy thousand inferiors. . . . I carry my head likea torch. . . .
Thursday
I am growing in Poland. I am also growing elsewhere. In Poland TheMarriage and Trans-Atlantic are being born and a volume encompassing all of my1958351stories, called Bakakaj (in memory of the street Bacacay, where I lived in BuenosAires). The French translation of Ferdydurke is almost ﬁnished. Negotiations con-cerning the French and Spanish edition of the Diary. Ivona is supposed to bestaged in Cracow and Warsaw. Correspondence in the matter of staging TheMarriage. An avalanche of articles and commentary in the Polish press. Ha, it’sﬁnally gotten off the ground, now they will fuel one another—the process of mygrowing is assured for many years to come! Gloria! Gloria! Sh . . . ! Sh . . . !Tandil!
Friday
I ate a very nice breakfast. . . . ‘‘You will be bored to death in Tandil. . . .’’Out of despair I went to Filefotto’s lecture on Beethoven’s symphonies. Filefotto,potato nose on a face like a bun, with a smile of indulgent irony, says: —There arethose who think that the master’s deafness provoked his talent. Nonsense, ladiesand gentlemen, how absurd! Deafness does not cause talent. His talent was a resultof the French Revolution, it opened Beethoven’s eyes to social inequality!I see Beethoven in the little puff-pastry hands of Filefotto; I see how, usingBeethoven like a baton, he shatters Inequality. Ah, Beethoven in the hands ofFilefotto!At the same time, in the deeper strata of my being there is something likecontentment, like a liberating joy at the thought that an inferior can use a superior.
Saturday
Yesterday, while I was writing, the door opened and in walked Ada, short,small, teeny-tiny—shriveled to microscopic proportions by her pale fear. She hadjust had an operation. She can barely stand on her feet. In Buenos Aires I tried totalk her into coming here for a ‘‘nachkur’’ as soon as she was able to move. So hereshe is. Henry, her husband, will appear in a few days, and until then Ada willwallow in anxiety. ‘‘Whatever made me come here? What am I doing here?!’’ Wewent for coffee to a café. ‘‘God, what a café!’’ ‘‘Ada, get ahold of yourself. . . .’’ ‘‘Ican’t get ahold of myself. Why am I here?’’ ‘‘It would be nice if you could get aholdof yourself. . . .’’ ‘‘I can’t get ahold of myself because I’m not all here yet. What kind352Volume 2of coffee is this supposed to be?’’ ‘‘Why, it’s the same kind of coffee as everywhereelse. . . .’’ What do you mean, the same. . . .’’ ‘‘What kind of horse is that supposed tobe?’’ ‘‘A horse like every other, quite ordinary, as you can see.’’ ‘‘This horse is notordinary because I have not started living here yet!’’
Wednesday
I didn’t know what to do. I remembered that N. N., the owner of thebazaar, had invited me for supper, and I went . . . to try my luck, maybe it’ll workout. . . . But at the sight of me a call to arms was sounded, the guards were doubled,the cannon were wheeled out.I had the impression that I was attacking a bulwark. The man of the housewas behind a breastwork of congeniality. The lady of the house and her aunt,Raquel, an old woman, manning the earthworks of holy Catholic principles, wereready to ﬁre in the event that I blurted out some heresy (one never knows withthese intellectuals!). The daughter, decked in an armor of token smiles, offered asalad. The son, an engineer, in a soft shirt, plump, neat, little moustache, ring,watch, comfort-loving—a masterpiece of self-sufﬁciency.
Friday
Yes . . . The bourgeoisie is distrustful. And the proletariat? I don’t under-stand it! I can’t understand it! Ah, for at least a half hour I tried to ‘‘understand’’ theworker, standing on one corner, staring at the one opposite. How and what does hethink about? What sort of thoughts does he have, how do they form themselves? Itcan’t be done. There is some accursed gap—some sort of hole in him, throughwhich I cannot pass. Why can I understand children, young working-class peopleso well, without difﬁculty—but an adult peasant or worker is locked in by a strangeemptiness, awful vacuum? . . .
Sunday
Look at them, en familias, circling the square on their Sunday walk. They’regoing in circles! It is impossible to believe they walk in circles. This reminds one of1958353the elementary movement of planets and goes back a million years into primalexistence. Until space itself seems to bend, Einstein-style, for even while movingforward they are constantly returning. The disarray of this procession! Upstanding,calm, bourgeois faces sparkling with Italian and Spanish eyes, teeth peering outfrom friendly lips—and this is how that decent petite bourgeoisie promenades withits wives and children.Soldiers!A column vibrating with the rhythmic stomping of jackboots marches infrom Rodriguez Street. It intrudes onto the square, like a blow. Cataclysm. Thepromenade is interrupted, everyone runs to admire the soldiers! It is as if the squaresuddenly came to life . . . but what a disgrace! Ha, ha, ha, allow me to laugh—ha,ha, ha, ha! An invasion of pinioned legs, and bodies, inserted into uniforms, slavebodies, welded together by the command to move. Ha, ha, ha, ha, gentlemenhumanists, democrats, socialists! Why, the entire social order, all systems, author-ity, law, state and government, institutions, everything is based on these slaves,barely grown children, taken by the ear, forced to pledge blind obedience (Opriceless hypocrisy of this mandatory-voluntary pledge) and trained to kill and toallow themselves to be killed. The general gives orders to the major. The majorgives orders to the lieutenant. After which the hard palms of the pledged andtrained ﬁeld hands grab riﬂes and begin to ﬁre away.But all systems, socialist or capitalist, are founded on enslavement, and, totop it off, on the enslavement of the young, my dear gentlemen rationalists, hu-manists, ha, ha, ha, my dear gentleman democrats!
Tuesday
Much of what happens to me in Tandil is indistinct . . . dark . . . like thatencounter with Ricardon. I met him in a café, a quiet, middle-aged man. He said:—Gombrowicz? Ah, I don’t know your books, but I have read about you. Mallea(an Argentinean writer) mentioned you in Leoplan (a weekly).—Yes, that’s true. But that was ﬁfteen years ago.—Yes, about ﬁfteen or so.—But it was just one sentence—as far as I can remember—he mentionedme only in one sentence. . . .354Volume 2—Yes, exactly, one sentence. Your name ﬁxed itself in my memory.—But it is impossible, that you should remember such an insigniﬁcantremark after ﬁfteen years especially since it concerns an author you have neverread!—N-n-n-o, why not? It just ﬁxed itself in my . . .??????? Darkness. A wall. I understand nothing. I ask no more because Iknow that I will learn nothing. I grow faint. . . .
Wednesday
Much of what happens to me in Tandil is so . . . inexplicable, as if theperson I was talking to and I were just missing each other. The vapor of what is leftunsaid rises between them and me. The riddles are multiplying. I am a hundredtimes more of a foreigner and I carry my foreignness within me. The mistakes aremultiplying. My contacts with them are cautious and trite. I have lost my agility—Iknow that I am clumsy—and I almost conceal myself. They also hide themselvesbehind themselves.The curtain, the smoke is thickening. . . . Timidity is growing. . . . A doubledarkness, made of my and their shame, is rising. Shame because when they ﬁndout that I am a writer, they shrink back into their shells like snails. Shame—I amashamed, because I am alone against thousands.Half-light, curtain, darkness, smoke, timidity—as in a church, as before thealtar of a growing mystery . . .
Thursday
Our greatest holiness is contained in our most ordinary commonness. Theonly time I am not ashamed of this word is when I use it in regard to somethingtrivial, something that is its opposite.
Friday
I am not the ﬁrst to seek the Divine in what I cannot bear . . . because Icannot bear it. . . .1958355On one of the hills, at one end of avenida Espania, rises an enormous cross,which dominates the city—and because of this becomes a kind of liturgy grownlazy, loitering in jeering, shameless Mediocrity, content with itself and laughingwith its hand over its mouth . . . something like parody and trash . . . a lower,giggling mystery play—but not less holy (in its own way) than its higher version.
Saturday
The slender trunks of the eucalyptus forest growing out of a hillside plowedup by boulders are stonelike—the mountain, forest, leaves, everything is ossiﬁed,and a solemn stony silence visits this slender and clean, dry, and translucentimmobility, brightened by pools of sun. Cortes and I walk along the path. Groupssculpted in marble present the story of Golgotha, the entire hillside is devoted toGolgotha and is called Calvario. Christ falling under the weight of the cross—Christ ﬂogged—Christ and Veronica . . . the whole grove is full of that tormentedbody. On the forehead of one of the Christs is written—in the hand of one ofCortes’s disciples: Viva Marx! Cortes, of course, is not concerned with the ﬁguresof Christ’s Passion—he is a materialist—and he lectures to me zealously on adifferent holiness, namely that of the Communists’ war with the world for theworld, that man has no choice but to conquer the world and ‘‘humanize’’ it . . . if hedoes not want to remain its comic and repulsive clown, its repugnant tumorforever. . . . Yes, he says, I agree with you, man is antinature, he has his ownseparate nature; he is, by his very nature, in the opposition; furthermore, we cannotavoid a showdown with the world; either we will introduce our own human order,or we will become the pathology and absurdity of being for all eternity. Even if thisbattle is hopeless, it alone is capable of realizing our humanity together with itsdignity and beauty—the rest can lead only to humiliation. . . . This credo soars andreaches the peak where the enormous Christ on the cross presides; I, from here,from below, see through the tapering eucalyptus the arms and legs nailed to wood;I note in passing that this God and this atheist are saying exactly the same thing. . . .We are practically at the cross. I steal a glance at the body tormented by itsliver, like Prometheus (this is what torture on the cross consists of, agonizing painsto the liver). Reluctantly I recall the complete rigidity of the cruciﬁx wood, whichis incapable of yielding to the writhing ﬂesh for even a millimeter and cannot be356Volume 2horriﬁed at the suffering, even if it exceeds all limits and becomes somethingimpossible—this little game between the absolute indifference of the torturingwood and the limitless pressure of the body, this mutual, eternal missing of thewood and the body, shows me, almost in a ﬂash, the wretchedness of our predica-ment—the world breaks into the body and the cross. In the meantime, next to me,the atheistic apostle, Cortes, does not cease voicing the necessity of a differentstruggle for salvation. ‘‘The Proletariat!’’ I look askance at Cortes’s body, thin,meager, nervous, bespectacled, hideous and bleary-eyed, undoubtedly with anaching liver, tormented by ugliness, so painful, so awfully repulsive—and I see thathe, too, is cruciﬁed.I am caught as if in the crossﬁre between two agonies, one of which isdivine, the other godless. But both shout: struggle with the world, rescue it—thenman again takes on everything, unable to ﬁnd himself a place, rebellious, and thecosmic, all-embracing, universal Idea explodes with force. . . . Before me, below,the city, from which one can hear car horns and the sound of immediate life,limited and shortsighted. Ah, to escape from this high place down to that onebelow! I lack oxygen here at the top between Cortes and the cross. This is tragic,that Cortes has brought me here to repeat with other, godless lips the same abso-lute, extreme, universal religion, this mathematics of Universal Justice, Univer-sal Purity!Suddenly I notice that someone has written on Christ’s left leg: ‘‘Delia yQuique, verano 1957.’’The eruption of this scribble in . . . no, let us say rather the intrusion ofthese fresh, ordinary, and untired bodies . . . this breeze, this wave of a human lifethat was relatively content . . . this breath of a miraculously holy naïveté in exis-tence . . . Darkness. Mist. Veil. Smoke. What religion is this?
Sunday
What religion is this whose incense assailed me through Delia and Quique,when I found myself on Golgotha, between Christ and Cortes?I said to Cortes: —Why do you, atheists, deify ideas? Why don’t you deifypeople?The divinity of the general is obvious. Isn’t his ﬁnger basically the same as1958357the ﬁnger of the most miserable of soldiers? Yet one crook of the general’s ﬁngersends tens of thousands of people to their deaths—they will go and die without evenasking about the meaning of the sacriﬁce. What more valuable thing than one’sown life can man offer the Highest God? If a man dies at the command of anotherman, this means that one man can be God to another man. He who is ready to stopliving at the command of his leader—why should he recoil from falling to his kneesbefore him!And the divinity of the Chairman? And the divinity of Directors or Pro-fessors? And the divinity of a Landowner or Artist? Service—slavery—a humblesubmission—the losing of oneself in another man—succumbing entirely to theHigher—this penetrates human kind to the viscera. Ha, you atheists-democratswould like to have people lined up evenly, like rows of vegetables, and subjugatedto the Idea. But this horizontal image of humanity is disturbed by another, verticalimage . . . and these two images mutually destroy themselves, they do not submit toa common law, there is no one theory for them. Is this reason, though, to excludefrom consciousness the vertical image of humanity and to be content with just thehorizontal? I really don’t understand you, atheists. You are not sensible. . . . Why doyou close your eyes to this sacrament, if it takes place perfectly without God, andeven the absence of God is its conditio sine qua non? I, of course, do not see whymodern metaphysical anxiety could not express itself in the adoration of man, ifGod is lacking.In order for this to happen, all you would have to do is turn your attentionto a certain property of mankind, its unceasing need for form. It is like a wave,made up of a million tiny particles, which takes on a speciﬁc form every minute.Why, even in a small group of freely conversing people, you will notice their needto attune themselves to this or that form, which creates itself accidentally andindependently of their will by dint only of their mutual adjustment to one another. . . it is as if all together they assigned to each person his place, his ‘‘voice’’ in theorchestra. ‘‘People’’ are something that must organize itself every minute—never-theless, this organization, this collective shape, creates itself as the by-product of athousand impulses and is, in addition, unforeseen and does not allow itself to beruled by those who make it up. We are like tones from which a melody issues—likewords forming themselves into sentences—but we are not in control of what weexpress, this expression of ours strikes us like a thunderbolt, like a creative force, it358Volume 2arises from us unreﬁned. Wherever form arises, however, there will also be Superi-ority and Inferiority—and that is why among people the process of elevating oneperson at the cost of others takes place—and the thrust upward, even if it elevatesjust one person, even if it is the most absurd and unjust, will be an absolutecondition of form; it will also mean the creation of a higher sphere within human-ity, dividing it into levels; from the bosom of the common people will come a morenoble kingdom, which, for the inferior, will be both a horrible burden and amagniﬁcent elevation. Why do you refuse to honor the accidental world of—if notgods, then demigods—that issues from us? Who forbids you to see in this a Deityarising from the people themselves, not descending from the heavens? Doesn’t thisphenomenon possess divine attributes, which are a result of interhuman power,that is, superior and creative, in relation to each of us separately? Don’t you see thathere Superiority is created in a way that is not controllable? Why has your reason,atheists, surrendered itself with such passion to abstractions, theories, ideas, jus-tiﬁcations, without having noticed that here, right under its very nose, concretely,humanity reels off Gods and new revelations like a ﬁrework? Would this seemunjust, immoral, to you—perhaps unjustiﬁed spiritually? But you forget that ifyour spirit were able to conceive it, it would not be a Superior force or even aCreative force.If only in the end I, I personally, could have ditched, eluded, the Idea—tolive permanently in this other church made of people. If I could have forcedmyself to acknowledge this deity—and not concern myself anymore with absolutesand just feel above me, not high, barely a yard above my head, the play of creativeforces, born of us as the only attainable Olympus—and to worship this. The Mar- riage contains this liturgy and I was not joking when I wrote in the introduction:here the human spirit adores the interhuman spirit. Still, I have never been capa-ble of prostrating myself—and between the interhuman God and me grotesque-ness was always born instead of prayer. . . . Too bad!—I say this sincerely.—Too bad!For only He—this demigod born of people, ‘‘superior’’ to me but only by an inch,something like a ﬁrst initiation, such an imperfect God in a word, in proportion tomy limitations—could extricate me from this accursed universalism which I can-not handle and restore a salutary concreteness. Ah, to ﬁnd one’s limits! To limitoneself! To have a limited God!I write this bitterly . . . because I do not believe that this leap into limitation1958359will ever happen to me. The cosmos will continue to devour me. Therefore, I amwriting this not altogether seriously, pooh, as rhetoric . . . but I feel the presence ofhuman natures different from my own around me, I feel this otherness surround-ing me, containing solutions inaccessible to me . . . therefore, I leave all this to thatotherness to do with it what it wants.
Tuesday
I saw him again! Him! That boor! I saw him while having a nice littlebreakfast in the café suspended over the gardens. O holy proletariat! He (a fruitvendor who came in a wagon) was mostly dumpy and butt-heavy—but he was alsostubby-ﬁngered and chubby-cheeked and a stocky, ruddy, greedy gut straight froma good snooze in his bed-clothes with a hot chick and right from the outhouse. I say‘‘right from the outhouse’’ because his butt was stronger than his mug; he was allbutt. The whole was characterized by an incredible striving for boorishness, hisliking and relishing of it, stubborn persistence in it, diligent and active transforma-tion of the whole world into boorishness. Plus, the guy was in love with himself.What was I to do with him? I drank coffee with Bianchotti, to whom I saidnothing.—What was I to do? If only inferiority were always young! Young! Youth isits salvation, its natural and sanctifying ingredient . . . no, beguiling inferiority isnot a problem for me . . . but to ﬁnd myself eye to eye with, not a boy but apeasant—and to have to bear him in his double ugliness of an aging boor.Double? Quadruple ugliness—because I, who look at him with all of mybourgeois reﬁnements, complete his repulsiveness, I match it, like a negative; weare two monkeys, one coming out of the other. . . . Two aging monkeys. Brrr . . . Doyou know what the worst meeting of all is? To meet a lion in a desert? A tiger in aforest? A ghost? The devil himself? What an idyll! It is worse, a hundred timesworse, when a pale intellectual comes upon a heavyset boor in the absence of anyyouth! This meeting will take place in mutual adult-human revulsion, which youwould never experience with a lion that devoured you; it will be bathed in physicaldecay; and that you must bear this man, together with yourself, in this abschmack, in the sauce of this idiosyncracy, in the curse of this caricature!This adult boor torments and exhausts me. . . . I cannot get away from him!That walking abomination!360Volume 2Thursday
Hitler, Hitler, Hitler . . . What rock did he crawl out from under? In theﬂurry of my life, in the chaos of events, I have long since noticed a certain logic inthe accumulation of plots. If a certain thought becomes dominating, facts strength-ening it from the outside begin to multiply, it then looks as if external reality werebeginning to cooperate with the internal one. Not long ago I noted here that I wascalled—by mistake of course—a fascist! Now, when I accidentally entered anunfamiliar part of Tandil, the barrio Rivadavia, chalk grafﬁti smeared on the walls,scribbled on boulders, caught my eye:‘‘loor y gloria a los martires de nurenberg’’ (Glory to the martyrs ofNuremberg).A Nazi in Tandil? And such a fanatical one? After so many years? Thisfanaticism, where does it come from?—in Tandil—why here? . . . This again will beone of those Tandil blind spots, stupors, most certainly some absurdity . . . which Iwill not even attempt to unravel . . . but (keeping in mind the ‘‘fascism’’ alreadyoffered me) it looked as if this drunkard were drinking a toast to me. . . . Anallusion? I have known for a long time that many are the allusions to me and manyhave drunk my health. . . .Moreover, this Hitler pounces on me, because a boor disgusted me, be-cause I am vomiting up the boor having been vomited up by him.
Friday
Hitler was pounded into dirt and dust, and to top it off (in fear of his resurrec-tion) he has been characterized post mortem as a diabolical mediocrity, a raucoushell-born sergeant-megalomaniac. You have soiled his legend. You did this out offear. But fear is also a form of homage. I would advocate not being afraid of Hitlerpost mortem—he rose on someone else’s fear, oh, that he not rise, again, on yours.What strikes one about this hero (and why shouldn’t I call him a hero?) ishis incredible boldness in reaching an extreme, the ultimate, the maximum. Hebelieved that the man who is less afraid wins—that the secret of power is to go onestep farther, that one single step farther that others are incapable of taking—that hewho terriﬁes with his audacity is impossible to withstand and is therefore devastat-ing—and he applied this principle as much to people as he did to nations. His1958361tactics were as follows: go one step farther in cruelty, cynicism, deception, cun-ning, boldness, go that one mad step jolting you out of the normal, that oneunbelievable, impossible, completely unacceptable step . . . to stand your groundwhen others, horriﬁed, call: I pass! That is why he thrust the German people andEurope into cruelty—he desired the cruelest life as the ultimate gauge of thecapacity to live.He would not be a hero if he were not a coward. His supreme violence wasthat perpetrated upon himself when transforming himself into Might—therebymaking weakness in himself impossible—cutting off his own retreat. His supremeresignation was his resignation from the other possibilities of existence. An interest-ing problem: how did he pop up as the god of the German people? One shouldassume that he at ﬁrst ‘‘bound himself’’ to only a few Germans—‘‘bound himself,’’that is, proposed himself as a leader—and this was achieved by personal distinction,for on this scale, in the company of a few people, personal qualities still have somevalue. And in this ﬁrst phase, when the bond was still fairly loose, Hitler must havehad to endlessly repeat his arguments; convince, persuade, bandy his idea—for hewas dealing with people who were subordinating themselves to him voluntarily.But all of this was still very human and very ordinary; there always existed, forHitler and his subordinates, the opportunity to back out, each of them could breakaway, choose something else, bind themselves to others in a different way. Imper-ceptibly, however, there came into play the action of a practically unnoticeableactor, namely, the number, the growing number of people. As the number grew,the group entered another dimension, almost inaccessible to one man. Too heavy,too massive, it began to live its own life. It is possible that each member trusted theleader only a little; however, that little bit multiplied by increasing numbers be-came a dangerous blast of faith. And lo and behold, there came a moment wheneach of them felt, rather uneasily, that he no longer knew what the others would doto him (the others of whom there were so many, whom he did not know) if itoccurred to him to say ‘‘I pass’’ and to take to his heels. The minute he realized this,the doors slammed shut. . . . This, however, was not enough for Hitler. He, fortiﬁed by this mass ofpeople, had already grown—but he was not sure in the least about his people orhimself. There was no guarantee that his private nature, his ordinary humanity,might not suddenly stir in him—he had not yet completely lost control of his own362Volume 2fate and he could still say ‘‘no’’ to his own greatness. Here then arose the necessityof transferring everything to a sphere higher and no longer accessible to the indi-vidual being. In order to do that, Hitler had to act not with his own energy, but withthat which the mass supplied him—that is, a power that surpassed his own. That iswhat happened. With the help of his subordinates and followers and by exploitingthe tensions that arose between him and them, by extracting the maximum au-dacity from them in order to become even more audacious himself and to arousethem to even greater audacity, Hitler drives the whole group to the boiling point,and makes it more fearsome as a group, together exceeding individual capacity.Each, not excluding the leader, is aghast. The group enters an abnormal state. Thepeople who make up the group lose control of themselves. Now no one can backout because they are no longer in a ‘‘human’’ but rather in an ‘‘interhuman,’’ or‘‘suprahuman,’’ realm.Let us note that this is all very similar to theater . . . to playacting. . . . Hitlerpretended to be bolder than he was so that others would be forced to join in thegame—but the game elicited the reality and created facts. The masses of people,obviously, do not grasp this mystiﬁcation; they judge Hitler according to his deeds—and lo, a nation of millions of people recoils in fear before the decimating will ofthe leader. The leader becomes great. Strange, this greatness. This is a magniﬁca-tion to incredible dimensions, inﬁnitely astounding—because the word, deed,smile, anger, exceed the reach of a normal man, resounding like thunder, tram-pling other existences, the same, after all, basically no less important. . . . But thestrangest characteristic of this magniﬁcation is that it creates itself from the outside—to Hitler, everything grows in his hands, but he himself is the same as he was,ordinary, with all of his weaknesses; this is a dwarf who reveals himself to beGoliath; this is a common man who is God from the outside; this is the soft humanpalm striking like a club. And Hitler is now in the claws of that Great Hitler, notbecause he has not retained his usual, private feelings or thoughts, his privatereason, but because they are too small and too weak and can do nothing against theGiant that penetrates him from the outside.Let us notice, too, that at the moment the process reaches the suprahumanstage, the idea is no longer needed. It is indispensable at the beginning, when onehas to convince, unify supporters to themselves—now it is almost superﬂuousbecause man, as such, does not have much to say in this new, suprahuman,1958363dimension. People begin to pile up. Pressures are created. A shape arises having itsown reason and logic. The idea exists merely for the sake of appearances; it is thefacade behind which the possession of man by man takes place, creating itself ﬁrst,and only later asking about its meaning.
Saturday
Farewell, Tandil! I am leaving. My suitcase is packed.I pour my crisis regarding democratic thinking and universal feeling ontopaper because not I alone—know this—not I alone, if not today, then in ten years,will be assailed by the desire to have a clearly delineated world and a clearlydelineated God. Prophecy: democracy, universality, equality, will not be capableof satisfying you. Your desire for duality will grow stronger and stronger—a desirefor a dual world—dual thinking—dual mythology—in the future we will be payinghomage to two different systems simultaneously and a magic world will ﬁnd aplace for itself next to a rational one.

I throw myself onto the bed— I rest—usually with Andrzej Bobkowski’s PenSketches. Two thick volumes. A diary. Subtitle: ‘‘France 1940–44.’’I am a passionate reader of diaries, the cavern of someone else’s life drawsme in, even if it is embroidered or fabricated—but this way or that, it is a brothmade of the taste of reality and I like knowing, for example, that on 3 May 1942Bobkowski was teaching his wife to ride a bike in the Vincennes forest. And I?364Volume 2What was I doing on that day? You will see, or you probably will not see: that in twohundred or a thousand years a new science will arise that determines the connec-tions between various people in time and then it will be plain that what happens toone is not without connection to what has happened to someone else. . . . And thissynchronization of existences will open new perspectives, but enough. . . . Bobkow-ski’s notes concern two of my interests, France and Poland—this is the main reasonthat I study them. They are written with fervor and passion, although I assume thisdidn’t happen without a little touching up ex post. The heat of this criticism resultsin criticism that immediately arouses criticism of the initial criticism. . . , etc.—(themeaning of this statement will become a little clearer in a moment).Homelands . . . How is one to get at them? This is almost a forbiddensubject. When a man writes about his homeland, his style gets twisted. How doesone write about Poland, for example, without falling into that classic ‘‘because weare Poles,’’ without making a European of oneself, without making a face, withoutdenigrating oneself, without making oneself superior—without claptrap, attacks,without biting, kicking, or roughing up . . . how does one thrust ﬁngers into one’sown wounds without contorting one’s face with pain? How does one tickle thisAchilles’ heel without making a clown of oneself? I discover in Bobkowski’s bookthat in the years 1940–44, the same feelings were hatching in him that crawled allover me when the outline of Trans-Atlantic was ripening—he also grumbles, reb-els, blasphemes. . . . But in me, perhaps because of the greater geographic distance,or perhaps as a result of the greater spiritual distance (an artistic work is one thing, adiary another), this anti-Polish process was frozen, I always wrote about Polandcold, as one of the obstacles making life difﬁcult for me. For me, Poland was and isonly one of my many troubles; I did not forget even for a moment about thesecondary importance of this topic. In his diary, Bobkowski, who is younger, is lesscold than I am—he pushes Poland away from himself, but in pushing it away, hecuts his hands until they bleed. I want to liberate myself!—he shouts—I will notimmolate myself on this altar, I want to live at my own expense . . . but it is exactlythis passionate cry that shows that his umbilical cord has not been severed—itsnegation would express itself better in a quiet, even ordinary voice, one of thoseindifferent voices that remove the theme from central importance. The ‘‘sketches’’would have been stronger stylistically if Bobkowski’s open struggle with the myth ofPoland had been deleted from them.1958365The confusion in our heads regarding this ‘‘universalism,’’ which has be-come fashionable for us, is extraordinary. Let us take Mr. Kisiel, for example. Formany of us universalism is equal to not writing about Poland and practically notwriting in Polish. For example, Mr. Micha™ K. Pawlikowski. In his review of JózefMackiewicz’s Contra, we read:
‘‘I would not hesitate to call Mr. Mackiewicz the most ‘un-Polish’ of all Polishwriters. Indeed, the setting and climate of Road to Nowhere are a corner offormer Lithuania and—if one does not count the language—so-called Polish-ness is not the ‘tuning fork’ of the novel. The plot of The Careerist would bepossible in any country. Finally, Contra is a work whose author a foreign readerwould not conclude was Polish.’’
After which Mr. Pawlikowski decrees that I am a ‘‘very Polish’’ writer, andMackiewicz, because of the above-mentioned traits, is ‘‘universal.’’But why, Mr. Pawlikowski? What does the universal humanity of an authorhave to do with his subject?Mackiewicz is—of course—an artist of the Polish borderlands . . . but this—it is obvious—in no way interferes with his ‘‘universal humanity.’’ Because one hasnothing to do with the other.The most universal French or Italian writers were simultaneously the mostFrench or Italian writers—because art is (as we have known long and well) theelevation of a private, particular, local, even parochial concreteness to the heightsof the universal . . . to cosmic proportions . . . The most worldly of Chopin’s melodies are the most Polish melodies—forart is (it is almost ridiculous to have to lecture on this) a demonstration of thetypical, universal, and eternal element in that which is concrete, individual, andephemeral.And it is really ridiculous that Jacek Boche ´ nski blusters (like Kisiel) that inTrans-Atlantic I have ‘‘an unhealthy romance and mad obsession’’ with my Polishheritage. With what am I supposed to have it? My Chinese heritage?Let us return, however, to Bobkowski. One could say several things abouthow in his diary he is working on a new style for the Liberated Pole . . . and notwithout an exhausting pushing and shoving . . . for Bobkowski, a lively intelligenceand talent, sees with horror how, after crawling out of Poland on his hands and366Volume 2knees, he falls into a new stereotype, this time an antinational one . . . and he mustnow ﬁnd some sort of antidote for this convention of Polishness à rebours . . . andthat this new form again demands to be corrected. In a work of art perhaps thiswould be shocking. But in a diary? Here we want to have an author in person andan author at the boiling point, still imperfect. And let us look at the date. Who inthose years 1940–44 was not at the boiling point?But it is not Poland that is the most interesting in Bobkowski’s diary, butFrance.France, which in the course of centuries became an international complex.This begs for psychoanalysis. France turns people into idiots—entire nations areenchanted by France—by mythic France and a fairy-tale Paris! Everywhere inAmerica I come across this stupeﬁed: Ah, Paris, ah, Paris! But this altar stands in ourbackyard too, and prayers, curtsies, capers, leaps, contortions, also take place backthere—although I will bypass that delightful second-hand Frenchness, that abso-lutely indefatigable imitation, practiced by all those Messrs. Sakowski, that endlessbowing to the myth. No, not only former members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairsare so culturally disoriented, the devotion penetrates all the way through the uppersocial classes, and Bobkowski, a Polish intellectual living in Paris, was unable toavoid its spell. But the ‘‘historical’’ weight of his confessions consists of the ap-pearance here of the will to destroy the myth—and just as it attacks Poland, it nowthrows itself with fury onto France, and the young and stormy arm strikes at its owndream. Here our conversation with France begins from a different position andalthough the author has not yet discovered his complete sovereignty, the tonebecomes inﬁnitely sharper and more to the point, the accent difﬁcult to deﬁne,betraying that the romance is over once and for all and that only a settling ofaccounts remains. The tone and accent are all the more valuable to me in that theyare contained in notes concerning everyday and ordinary events.
Sunday
After returning to Tandil, I found the novel Conspiracy sent to me from Po- land by the author, Mr. Stefan Kisielewski (‘‘Kisiel’’) with the conciliatory dedication:
‘‘To W.G., the ‘fellow’ who pretended he didn’t understand my article abouthim, his constant critical-enthusiastic reader—Kisiel, Cracow. 18.XII.57.’’1958367I replied:
‘‘Dear Sir,‘‘Please forgive me for not thanking you sooner for the copy of Conspir-acy with your dedication, but I have been away from Buenos Aires for aboutsix months.‘‘Great—the dedication is nice—but why do you write such idioticthings about me in the paper? I say ‘idiotic’ not to offend you, but because youare being beneath yourself when you do so. Your ﬁrst piece contained nonsense,which I could understand only by ascribing to you a lack of knowledge aboutthe material—that you had forgotten Ferdydurke and knew the Diary fromsome fragment or other in Kultura. The second article shows more reading, yetyou still stand by your thesis, so simplistically childish and incompatible withmy person, category, reality.‘‘You think that I can be avant-garde and anachronistic, intelligent andstupid, innovative and conventional—that I can write penetrating books andthen surrender myself to such lousy banalities as those you attribute to me? No,this doesn’t happen. You conceived of my settling accounts with Polishnessshallowly, as if the newspaper were speaking and not art. You did not under-stand its genesis or its ties with the overall form of my art and my worldview.‘‘This doesn’t hurt me—it even suits me, because the more you reduce me,the more ﬁercely will I explode, and the polemic with you will be a polemic with theshallows and the shoals of contemporary Polish thought (in its Catholic variety).But I am amazed that you appear in this role as coryphaeus. This is not for you.You are worthy of a better fate. I write this in all good will, because I assume that‘personally’ we are not enemies. Please do not be angry with this letter. . . .’’

Tyrmand!* Talent! This is like a barefoot Warsaw wench in the eyes of ateenager, like a fat Warsaw cook in the eyes of a student, like a drunken wh— in theeyes of a street urchin! Dirt and tawdriness but desired and bewitching neverthe-less! What sex appeal† this saga has, 300 percent Varsovian, the same that once
*Leopold Tyrmand, Polish émigré writer who lived and died in the United States.†‘‘Sex appeal’’ in English in original.368Volume 2lurked in the doorways of the houses on Ho˙ za or ˙Zela˙zna—except that then it merely lurked, now it explodes!A criminal novel, a cheap romance? Why yes, and even worse: a romancefrom a back alley, full of ramshackle buildings and gutters. Yet this gleams, spurts,sounds, sings. . . . A romantic moon rises above the ruins of the city and brawlsreach me from dens, caverns, alleys—again!—how poetic. Tyrmand is the mostperfect continuation of our romantic poetry, he inherited its panache, he con-tinues its writing but in keeping with the new—proletarian—history. This is writingat the level of a street rufﬁan, pimp, racketeer, etc., but the spirit is the same. Not tomention . . . the body. That sinful Polish carcass with all of its little blemishes!A story, of course, that is lies from A to Z—for the pleasure of the reader andthe author alike. Yet how real and Polish is this lying in the area of the imagination,sentiment, and temperament. Do you know what this book is? Vodka, pure andsimple. The same vodka that somehow allowed the Poles to bear life before thewar, except that then they drank it out of shot glasses while today they are drinkingit straight out of the bottle. Out of it comes that murky ‘‘fantasy’’ without which theexcess of ﬂops and down-and-outs would be impossible to swallow.Flipping through Tyrmand’s pages is like walking the prewar streets ofKrucza or Ho˙ za, maybe even ˙Zela˙zna, on the trail of our pummeled history. Eventhen I knew Tyrmand was inevitable! That some sort of moon must rise roman-tically and explode! Yes, exactly! Exactly this kind of hooligan, ramshackle, beatenup, drunken and bashed-in mooniness. I remember a passage from X’s letter that Ireceived not long ago (from the States): ‘‘My God, this Poland is the grim dream ofa madman! That obscurity, suffocation, uncertainty and boredom. . . .’’ And fur-ther: ‘‘This new Pol’sza* makes me laugh because, God is my witness, the Saxon † period has stayed with us the longest and has left the deepest imprint. The nation isignorant, national democratic, truculent, boorish, lazy, belligerent and half-baked,sanctimonious and ‘infantile,’ and a Kremlin communism has been attached tothis mess. Only now how the dust must ﬂy from those besotted heads!’’

I do not have much to say on the subject of the victory of Artur Frondizi,who became the president of Argentina; on the other hand, I wish to note thatelections do not cease to amaze me. The day on which the vote of the illiteratemeans as much as the vote of the professor, the vote of the idiot as much as the voteof the wise man, the vote of the lackey as much as the vote of the potentate, the voteof the cutthroat as much as the vote of a virtuous man is for me the most confusedof days. I do not understand how this fantastic act can determine, for the next fewyears, something as important as the government of the country. On what sort offairy tale does authority base itself? How can this ﬁve-adjective fallacy constitutethe basis of social being?
Monday
I visited M. in the hospital—he has been dying for many months, more andmore in fact but, so his doctors say, he will go on dying for a few more weeks. He layimmobile, head on a pillow, eaten by death piece by piece, each day a little moredead. Was he suffering? Very much?In the room there were also a few living—I would say, assistants, becausethey were assisting death . . . with their hapless looks, separated from this martyr bythe conviction that there is no help and they must wait until he bites the dust.‘‘Man lives alone and dies alone’’—Pascal. Not entirely. Men live in a herd andhelp each other, only when death strikes does a man see he is alone . . . utterlyalone . . . like those expiring animals from which the herd moves away on a winter’snight. Why is human death still like the death of an animal? Why are our agoniesso isolated and primitive? Why have you been unable to civilize death?To think that this horrifying thing, this agony, prowls among us as wild as itwas in the ﬁrst days of creation. Nothing has been accomplished in the course ofthese thousand years, this wild taboo has not been touched! We cultivate televisionand use electric blankets, but we die wild. A timid injection by a doctor mayshorten suffering on the sly with increased doses of morphine. A shameful mea-sure, too small for the enormous universality of dying. I demand Houses of Deathwhere each person would have at his disposal modern means to an easy death.Where one could die easily, not by throwing oneself under a train or by hanging370Volume 2oneself from a hook. Where a weary, destroyed man could surrender to the friendlyarms of the specialist, so that he could be assured a death without torture ordisgrace.Why not—I ask—why not? Who prevents you from civilizing death? Reli-gions? Ah, this religion . . . today forbidding suicide, yesterday no less vociferouslyforbidding anesthesia . . . the day before yesterday allowing barter in slaves, per-secuting Copernicus and Galileo . . . this Church thundering condemnation, andthen retreating discreetly, quietly . . . what sort of guarantee do you have that in afew decades today’s condemnation of suicide will not ﬂag and come to nothing?Until that day we are supposed to die like dogs heaving and shuddering—we aresupposed to wait patiently, strewing this slow path with millions of agonizingdeaths described in obituaries as ‘‘after prolonged and agonizing suffering. . . .’’But, no, the bill for these ‘‘interpretations’’ of the holy texts is already too high andtoo bloody and it is better for the Church to give up scholasticism, which intrudestoo arbitrarily into life. If believing Catholics want to die in agony—that’s theirbusiness. But why don’t you, atheists, or people only loosely tied to the Church,have the audacity for something as simple as organizing your death? What inhibitsyou? You have done what you needed to do to move us easily from place to placewhen changing apartments; but when it comes to moving to the other world, youwant it to happen the old way, you want the ancient method of dying.What muddled clumsiness! And to think that each of you knows exactly:not a single person close to you will escape dying, unless, of course, that person hasthe extraordinary luck to have a sudden and unexpected death; each will begradually destroyed until his face becomes unrecognizable—and, knowing this,knowing this inevitable fate, you will not lift a ﬁnger to save yourselves the torment.What are you afraid of? That too many people will escape if you crack the gate abit? Allow those to die who choose death. Do not force anyone to live with thediscomfort of dying—this is too vile!The blackmail contained in artiﬁcially impeding death is a dirty trick, animpingement on the most valuable human freedom. For my greatest freedom iscontained in my capacity to pose Hamlet’s ‘‘to be or not to be?’’ and to answer itfreely. The life to which I have been sentenced can trample and disgrace me withthe cruelty of a wild beast, but there is in me one splendid and sovereign arrange-ment—that I can take my own life. If I choose, I do not have to live. I did not ask to1958371be brought into the world, but at least my right to leave remains . . . and this is thebasis of my freedom. And also of my dignity (because to live in dignity means to livevoluntarily). But the fundamental human right to death, which ought to be in-cluded in the constitution, has succumbed to a gradual and imperceptible conﬁs-cation—you have arranged things so that it would be as difﬁcult as possible . . . andas horrifying as possible . . . so that it would be more difﬁcult and more horrifyingthan things should be at our current level of technology. Not only does this expressyour blind afﬁrmation of life, which is quite animal—but also your unusually thickhide when it comes to pain you yourself are not yet feeling, and agony that is notyet yours—that stupid nonchalance with which one tolerates dying as long as itis someone else’s. All these different little considerations—dogmatic, nationalist,everyday-practical—all this theory, practice, spreads itself like a peacock’s tail—asfar as possible from death.

My springs pulsate in a garden whose gate is guarded by an angel with aﬂaming sword. I cannot enter. I will never get through. I am condemned to aneternal circling of the place where my truest enchantment is sanctiﬁed.I am not allowed in because . . . these springs bubble with shame likefountains! Yet there is the internal imperative: get as close as you can to the sourcesof your shame! I have to mobilize all my reason, consciousness, discipline, allthe elements of form and style, all the techniques of which I am capable, in orderto get closer to the mysterious gate of that garden, behind which my shame burstsinto ﬂower. What, in this case, is my maturity if not an auxiliary means, a sec-ondary matter?Eternally the same thing! Dress up in a splendid coat in order to step intoan inn on the docks. To use wisdom, maturity, virtue, in order to get close tosomething that is just the opposite!
Sunday
I can’t stand Balzac. His work, him. Everything in him is exactly what Idon’t like and don’t want to like. I can’t stand it! He is too contradictory and372Volume 2somehow repulsively, stupidly contradictory! A wise man—and such a dolt! Anartist—and how much bad taste from the most distasteful of epochs there is in him!A fatso—yet a conqueror, Don Juan, seedy womanizer. A distinguished man—yetsuch petit bourgeois vulgarity and such nouveau riche chutzpah! A realist—butalso a lousy, romantic dreamer. . . . Perhaps these antinomies should not disturbme; I know their role in life, in art . . . yes, only that in Balzac even antinomybecomes obese, repulsive, seedy, fat, and worse than coarse.I can’t stand his Human Comedy. To think how easily the best soup getsspoiled when one adds a spoonful of old grease or a bit of toothpaste to it. One dropof bad, pretentious, melodramatic Balzac is enough to make these volumes and hisentire personality unpalatable. They say that he is a genius, that one must betolerant because of this. The women who slept with his brilliant obesity knowsomething about this tolerance because in order to sleep with a genius, they musthave had to overcome many abominations in themselves. But I am not sure if thiscalculation is worth it and if it is in harmony with nature. In the realm of personalrelations—such as our relations with artists—sometimes the triﬂe has more mean-ing than monoliths of monumental service. It is easier to hate someone for pickinghis nose than to love him for composing a symphony. For the triﬂe is characteristicand describes the person in his everyday dimension.

On 4 February of this year (’58), I ﬁnished Pornograﬁa. This is what I havecalled it for the time being. I am not promising that the title will stay. I am in nohurry to publish it. Too many of my books have appeared in print lately.One of my most persistent needs, during the writing of this quite porno-graphic—in some places—Pornograﬁa was: to pass the world through youth; totranslate it into the language of youth, that is, into the language of attraction . . . Tosoften it with youth . . . To spice it with youth—so it allows itself to be violated.The intuition that dictated this to me is probably based on the convictionthat a Man is helpless against the world . . . by being only power, not beauty . . . and,furthermore, in order for him to be able to possess reality, it must ﬁrst be putthrough a being that can be attractive . . . that is, that can surrender itself . . . alower, weaker being. Here there is a choice—woman or youth. The woman I1958373dismiss because of the child, that is, because her function is too speciﬁc. Youth iswhat is left. And here one comes upon extreme formulas: maturity for youth, youthfor maturity.What is this? What have I written? Whether or not the accent I put on theSpirit of Youth and its Doings is worth anything . . . and how much will be hard totell for a while.

Sunday,Santiago del Estero
Yesterday, late in the evening, I ﬁnally reached Santiago after many hours ofthe train’s clattering and rolling: ﬁrst through the green lowlands of the Paraná, thenacross the entire province of Santa Fe, until, ﬁnally (after many, many kilometersmarked by poles that sped away from the train as it stole by somewhere near thatlake—so mysterious to me—of Mar Chiquita in northern Córdoba), a desert ex-panse overgrown with gnarled trees began that great white blot on the map thatstretches over tens of thousands of square kilometers of land and that means there isnot a living soul between settlements. The train speeds along. Through the windowsof the train car, hermetically sealed because of the all-pervasive sand, there isnothing to look at except those miserable little trees (growing out of the sand) andthe sparse grass. Night falls, and sometimes, when I put out the light on the windowwith my hand, those same trees ﬂit before my eyes. How many more hours remain ofthis trip and through what sort of surroundings? I don’t know, I fell asleep.And ﬁnally: Santiago.One of the oldest cities in Argentina. Founded by Francisco de Aguirre,supposedly on 23 December 1553. The beginnings of local history are mythical,distant and fantastic, even crazy, almost like a dream. At the beginning of thesixteenth century the Spanish conqueror, his head bursting with legends andblinded by the desire for gold and precious stones, tore his way into the soft Indiantribes (called the Huries, Lules Vilelas, Guaycurues, Sanavirones) living in theselands. These maniacs and rapists, criminals and heroes must have been excep-tionally courageous to immerse themselves in an unknown space that did not374Volume 2obstruct the imagination. Fourteen soldiers, their heads muddled with tales ofbejeweled cities, detached themselves from Sebastian Cabot’s expedition in theFort of Sancti Spiritus and blundered their way into the environs of Santiago forthe ﬁrst time, whereby they discovered the neighboring province of Tucumán,known today as the ‘‘Garden of Argentina.’’ Diego de Rojas also searched after themythical treasure called ‘‘the treasure of the Caesars’’ in 1542; and he was followedby Francisco de Mendoza, who marched on the fairy-tale cities, which were sup-posed to have been called ‘‘Trapalanda,’’ ‘‘Yungulo,’’ and ‘‘Lefal.’’ Afterward cameCaptain Nicolas de Heredia, Captain Francisco de Villagra, and about ten others.But this rather recent past is prehistory here, these are the murky beginnings thathave been blurred in the confused, unsettled, or unknown geography, in theswarming of wandering tribes, in the enormous, absorbing, but indistinct expanseover which the imagination of these conquerors galloped, dark, stubborn, deter-mined . . . and isolated from Spain by that enormous expanse of water. It was as ifthey were on another planet, free and accompanied only by the horse, which herebecame an alien and terrifying creature.The Hotel Savoy, where I was assigned an unsightly room without a win-dow and with doors that opened only onto the corridor—you have to leave alight on during the day. I washed up in my ‘‘private bathroom,’’ in which the onlyﬁxtures native to a bathroom were a faucet and a shower. The evening meal,however, was quite satisfactory: a wonderful chicken in sauce and a carafe of heavy,red wine.
Monday
I wanted to add that the day before yesterday, before I went to sleep,something happened to me, something rather indistinct. . . . I really don’t knowhow to take this and I am shaken. . . .After supper, which I ate in the hotel, I went out onto the square. I sat on abench, concealed by trees and bushes, great palm fronds over my head, and I wassomewhat stunned by the lightness of the apparel worn by this hot, starry night, itslaughter, its naked shoulders, while I was still in the damp winter of Buenos Airesand my thick winter jacket still warmed me! Such violent change: there it washarsh and cool, while here it was sensual and, at least so it seemed, carefree and1958375lighthearted. . . . Suddenly, it was as if I had immersed myself in the South (here itis called the ‘‘North’’ because it is in the southern hemisphere).The square turned round me like a carousel, with a laughing Saturdaycrowd from which enormous dark eyes and raven hair stared at me . . . scintillatinglaughter . . . limbs light as a dancer’s . . . cheerful voices, free and kind. . . . What’sthis? What’s this? The square is alight with the teeth of distant youth . . . for I am nothere, but elsewhere . . . my remoteness (because I still see the crowds on Corrientesand hear the honking of the cars) made them distant, even though they were rightbefore me. But I had not yet arrived. I watched as if I had no right to look, as if Iwere spying. . . .Silence rings in my ears. The eerie silence of a distant place—all thesounds are mute like in an old ﬁlm: I hear nothing. Sound frozen at the thresholdof its realization.In this silence, the parade on the square mutely intensiﬁes itself in arevelation of corporeal splendor, in a stunning play of eyes and lips, hands and legs.The snake stretching itself before me bursts into rainbows of beauties the likes ofwhich I have not seen before in Argentina and, dumbfounded, I ask myself: wheredoes this come from, here in Santiago?At the same time I discover that this does not exist, the taste of its absence isoverwhelming. I am felled by the sensation of its nonexistence and desperately lostin unfulﬁllment.
Sunday
Beauty! You will rise where you are sown! And you will be as youwere sown!(Do not believe in the beauty of Santiago. It is a lie. I have made it up!)
Monday
The sunlight is blinding and full of colors, as if ﬁltered through stainedglass. It seems to saturate objects with colors. Light and shadow. The aggressiveblue of the sky. Trees laden with golden and enormous pomedos, blooming red . . .yellow. . . . People walk around without jackets.376Volume 2I went to Miss Canal Feihoo’s place via a street dark with shade on one sideand white with light on the other. She is the sister of a writer who lives in BuenosAires. An older person full of the kind of suspicion (I can see this right away) thatmistresses of households have for restaurant meals that ‘‘are concocted who knowshow’’ and for globetrotters who are also ‘‘concocted who knows how.’’ But shereceived my request (I asked her to help put me in contact with the local literati)very kindly. Como no! she had said very quickly and simply. ‘‘There are a few, theyeven publish a magazine. I will call them immediately. . . . My brother meets withthem whenever he visits.’’When I returned to my room, I tried to get my impressions from theprevious night under control. They were exaggerated! I had been seeing things. . . .It’s true that here you see that ‘‘loveliness’’ so common in Argentina, there is a lot ofit, maybe even more than anywhere else . . . but there is also some sort of Indiandifference, a coloring that I have not seen until now . . . but should this be arevelation, no, this is no revelation. Besides, the perpetual problem of makingcontact with a new city and securing oneself company absorbed me and jarred meout of my ecstasy.
Tuesday
In the afternoon I have a rendezvous with Santucho (one of the literaryﬁgures and the editor of Dimension) in the Café Ideal.It smells of the East. Not a minute goes by without having some insistentlittle urchin thrust lottery tickets in your face. Then an old man with a millionwrinkles does the same: he pushes tickets into your face as if he were a child. Anold woman, strangely shriveled into an Indian design, enters and she too pokestickets into your face. A child grabs you by the leg and wants to shine your shoes,and another with a beautiful Indian head of hair offers you a newspaper. A soft, hot,lithe miracle, a girl-odalisque-houri, holds a blind man by the arm and guides himbetween the tables. Then someone jabs you in the back: a beggar with a small-boned, triangular face. I would not be surprised if a goat, mule, or donkey prancedinto this café.There are no waiters. You have to serve yourself.1958377A somewhat humiliating situation developed that nonetheless I can hardlypass over in silence.I sat with Santucho, who is heavyset and has a passionate, stubborn oliveface focused on the past and rooted in the past. He droned on about the Indianessence of these parts. Who are we? We don’t know. We do not know ourselves. Weare not Europeans. European thought, the European spirit, are something alienthat invades us, as the Spaniards once did. It is our misfortune that we have theculture of that ‘‘Western world’’ of yours which we have soaked up like paint, sothat today we must use European thinking and a European tongue, for lack of ourown Indio-American one, our lost substance. We are barren, because we have tothink about ourselves in a European way! . . . I listened to this somewhat suspectline of reasoning but was really watching a chango (sitting two stools away from us)who was with a sweet young thing. They were drinking: he, vermouth and she,lemonade. They sat with their backs to me and I could only guess at how theylooked from certain clues, such as the arrangement and immobile play of theirlimbs, that difﬁcult to describe inner freedom of nimble bodies. And I don’t knowwhy (was this some distant reﬂex from Pornograﬁa, which I had ﬁnished writingnot long ago, or a result of my excitement in this city?), it is enough to say that I hada vision of their invisible faces as beautiful, absolutely beautiful and probablyelegant and artistic, like movie stars . . . suddenly something happened as if there,between the two of them, they embodied the highest intensity of local beauty, herein Santiago . . . and this seemed all the more likely because, indeed, the veryoutline of this pair, as I saw it from where I was sitting, was as lively as it wassumptuous.Finally I could not stand it any longer. Excluding myself before Santucho(who was carrying on about European imperialism), I left the table on the pretext ofgetting a drink of water but really to stare into the face of the secret that was torment-ing me. To look into their faces: I was sure the secret would reveal itself like anapparition from Mount Olympus. In its own sublime elegance! Divinely weightlesslike a young colt! O what disillusionment! The chango was poking at his teeth with atoothpick and was saying something to his girl, who was eating the nuts that wentwith his vermouth. There was nothing more, nothing, the scene was so barren that Ialmost tripped, as if my adoration had been knocked out from under me!378Volume 2Wednesday
Scads of children and dogs!I have never seen so many and such gentle dogs! If a dog barks here, it ismerely in jest.The children are all darkly unkempt and skipping around . . . never have Iseen children who are so ‘‘picture perfect’’ . . . and delightful! Two little boys walkin front of me with their arms around each other’s necks and tell one anothersecrets. But how they do it! One of them points something out with his ﬁnger to agawking band of children. Another solemnly sings to a stick which he has pokedthrough a candy wrapper.Yesterday I saw the following in the park: a four-year-old toddler challengeda little girl to a boxing match. She hadn’t the slightest idea what that meant but,being taller and heavier, she gave it to him for all she was worth. A little group oftwo and three year olds in long shirts grabbed one another by the hands and beganto jump up and down, shouting in her honor: No-na! No-na! No-na!
Thursday
A strange repetition of the scene from the day before yesterday with San-tucho in the café, although this time with a slight variation.The restaurant is in the Hotel Plaza. I am sitting at the table of Dr. P.M., aSantiago lawyer, who represents the estates of wisdom contained in his library.With us was his barra, or group of café cronies: one doctor and a few businessmen. . . . I, armed with the best intentions, give myself up to a conversation aboutpolitics when . . . uh oh! I am once again distracted by another little couple straightout of a fairy tale . . . and there they are, sinking into one another, like one lakespilling over into another! Again, belleza! But I must hold up my end of theconversation at the table, I must contribute to this soup simmering with theplatitudes (spiced with hatred toward the U.S and with a panic-stricken fear of the‘‘temptations of imperialism’’) of South American nationalists: yes, unfortunately, Imust say something to this guy even though I am watching and listening to thebeauty taking place not far from me—I, a slave, in love with death and passionate,1958379I, an artist. . . . And again I ask myself how can it be that such marvels sit in thisrestaurant just a step away from . . . well, from this garrulous Argentina. . . . ‘‘Wehave always demanded morality in international relations. . . .’’ ‘‘Yankee and Britishimperialism tries to . . .’’ ‘‘We are no longer a colony! . . .’’ ‘‘All of this is pronouncedby my adversary (and not just today); I, on the other hand, cannot understand,cannot understand, cannot understand. . . . ‘‘Why does the United States grantloans to Europe but not to us? . . .’’‘‘The history of Argentina shows that we valued dignity above all else! . . .’’Oh, if only someone could yank the platitudes out of this otherwise appeal-ing people! This bourgeoisie, sipping wine here in the evening and maté duringthe day, is so whiny! If I were to tell them that compared with other nations theylive snug as bugs on their splendid estancias as big as half of Europe, and if I were toadd that not only are they not hurting but that Argentina is the estanciero of nations, an ‘‘oligarch’’ proudly sprawled over his splendid territories . . . I wouldgrievously offend them! Better not. . . . So this is exactly what I tell them to theirfaces! What do I care!There, there at the table is the Argentina that has beguiled me—it is quietbut has the sound of great art—no, no, not this one, which is garrulous, indolent,and overpoliticized. Why am I not sitting over there with them? My place is overthere! Next to the girl who is like a tremulous black and white bouquet, next to theyoung man who looks like Rudolph Valentino! . . . Belleza!But . . . what is happening! Nothing. Nothing, to the extent that even now Ido not know how and what it was that reached me from them . . . maybe a wordcaught midway . . . an accent . . . ﬂashing eyes. . . . Enough so that suddenly I wasinformed.That whole belleza was just like everything else! Like the table, chair,waiter, plate, tablecloth, like our discussion, it was in no way different—it was thesame—the same world, made of the same material.

Beauty? In Santiago? Where in the devil from?380Volume 2Thursday
What could possibly happen to you if a train takes you to a small town thatis remote . . . off the beaten track . . . unknown . . . colorful?What could possibly happen to you in a small town that put up no re-sistance . . . that was too congenial . . . or too timid . . . too naive?What could possibly happen to you in a place where nothing opposes youand nothing is capable of becoming your limits?
Saturday
First I write down the facts.I was sitting on a bench, in a park, and next to me sat a chango (apparentlyfrom the Escuela Industrial) and his older companion. ‘‘If you had gone outwh— — —ing,’’ the chango explained to his companion, ‘‘you would have had toscrape up at least ﬁfty. So I should get at least that much!’’How am I to understand this? I am convinced that here, in Santiago,everything can be understood in two ways: as extreme innocence or extremelicense. I would not be surprised to learn that the words I overheard were quiteinnocent, like a joke in a pupil’s conversation. But something a little more perverseis not out of the question. Nor is this archperversity excluded: that those words,having the meaning that I attributed to them, were, nevertheless, innocent . . . andeven in that case the greatest scandal would depend on the most perfect inno-cence. That ﬁfteen-year-old chango was obviously from a ‘‘good home.’’ His eyesshone with health, kindness, and gaiety. He had not said that wantonly but with theabsolute conviction of a person defending a just law. And, after all, he was laughing. . . that local laughter, certainly not excessive but rather engaging.A thin, iridescent, colorful, laughing face.Am I allowing myself to be fooled by the appearances of a nonexistentdepravity? It is difﬁcult to get at anything . . . here everything becomes a jungle inwhich I lose my way. . . .That girl, barely grown, is going around with a soldier from the eighteenthinfantry regiment? . . .Another changito, who made my acquaintance in ﬁve minutes, told mehow his father had died not long ago. If he told me this (as it appeared) to entertain1958381and amuse me with an interesting tale, then this would show that he is a decentand hospitable boy . . . but it would also prove that he is a monster. . . .A monster?That transparent, colorful, and blinding sunlight everywhere: in the spacesbetween trees, in the luminous cascades and streams between the walls and crowns oftrees. The goodness of that Santiago. Its equanimity. Its sedate smile. Eight childrenand three dogs around a palm tree. Ladies are out doing the shopping. Trees coveredwith violet or red blossoms peek from around walls, and a motoneta comes skimming down the middle of the road. The kind glances of Indian eyes. Swarms of bicycles.The sun sets. The streets close with distant landscapes of dark verdure.On the bench a niña is sitting, her ﬁgure straight out of a painting, fetlock,smooth wave, gleaming hair . . . but, in addition to this, she is beautifully andstrangely elongated . . . where did she get this, from what mixture of races . . . herbeau lies on a bench with his head in her lap, looking at the sky. He has a whitewindbreaker on and an almost triangular face, young and beautiful, without sin.And even if they succumbed to a crime on this bench, it would take place in someother dimension. Is the tone too high, too high-pitched for me to hear? Silence.
Sunday
This imperceptible madness, this innocent sin, those dark, languid eyes.. . . I am attracted by madness, I go to meet it, I! At my age! Catastrophe! For whatreason other than age am I attracted to madness . . . expecting that it will revive me,as I was, in all of my creative sensuality!I would receive sin which was and is inspiration with open arms becauseart is begotten of sin!Except that . . . there is no sin here. . . . What I would give to catch this littletown in the act! Nothing. There’s just the sun. And the dogs.That accursed body of theirs . . .
Monday
That accursed, easy body of theirs!Is this the heritage of those naked tribes who bent their backs so easily382Volume 2under the whip? When I complained to Santucho that here the body ‘‘does notsing,’’ and that nothing here wants to rise, he answered:—That’s the Indian’s revenge.—What revenge?—Oh yes. Surely you can see how much of the Indian there is in all of us.Those tribes of Huries and Lules that were settled here were degraded by theSpanish and reduced to the role of slave, servant. . . . The Indian had to defendhimself against the advantage of his master. He lived consumed by the thought notto submit to that superiority. How did he defend himself? By making fun ofsuperiority, by sneering at his master, he nurtured a talent for poking fun ateverything that aspired to superiority and rule. He demanded equality, mediocrity.In every ﬂight, in every spark, he saw the desire to dominate. . . . And now you havethe result. Now everything here is so ordinary. . . .This thickset, stubborn Santiago cacique is wrong, however. Everythinghere happens without sin, but also without jeering, sneering, malice, or irony. Thejokes are friendly and one senses goodness in the very tone of the language. It’s justthat . . . it will remain the secret of South America that decency, goodness, and thecommonplace are becoming very aggressive and even dangerous! I came to theconclusion that when that goodness accidentally hits me from the side with itslaughter, or when those boundless, inscrutable, and gentle eyes of a slave impaleme, I begin to have the vague feeling that I am meeting a masked threat.
Tuesday
Donkeys . . . goats . . . often remind me of Italy or the southern Pyrenees,the South in general.This is where the thought comes from that, in my settling of accounts withthis South America, there are more of the Nordic’s fears than anything else. It isthis shock, from the collision of North and South, that bothered me so much inEurope. Where the metaphysics of the North tumbles head over heels into thecorporeal concreteness of the South.No, this is not true, not true . . . and it is time to disclose the monstroussensuality of the North. I, for example . . . would I want to be metaphysics? . . .Wouldn’t I agree to be the body?1958383Oh! I am mortally in love with the body! The body is almost my only touch-stone. No spirit can redeem corporeal ugliness, and a man physically unattractive willalways hail from a race of monsters even though he may be Socrates himself! . . . Ah!how badly I need that consecration of the body! I divide humanity into the physicallyattractive and the physically repugnant, and the line between them is so distinct that itnever ceases to amaze me. And even though I can love someone ugly (Socrates), Iwould never be capable of being in love, that is, of drawing myself into the magiccircle, without a pair of divinely corporeal, attractive . . . enfolding . . . arms.Do you want another confession from me, a Nordic? My metaphysics existsto become ﬂesh . . . constantly . . . without respite. . . . It is like an avalanche with anatural tendency to head for the bottom . . . the Spirit? I will say that my greatestpride as an artist is not at all in inhabiting the kingdom of the Spirit, but in the factthat I have not broken relations with the ﬂesh. I take more pride in the fact that Iam sensual than in the fact that I am knowledgeable about the Spirit. My passion,my sinfulness and darkness, are more valuable to me than my light. More? ShouldI keep confessing these things? I will tell you, therefore, that the greatest artisticachievement of my life is not the few books I have written, but only and simply thatI have not turned my back on ‘‘illicit love.’’ Ah! because to be an artist means to bemortally, incurably, passionately, but also wildly in love and without wedlock. . . .‘‘And the word became ﬂesh’’ . . . who could possibly exhaust the radicalcontents of these words?
Tuesday
Is the body of an Indian more of a body? Is their slave body more of a body?Is slavery closer to love out of wedlock?Questions that you, Santiago, drown in the twitter of birds.
Thursday
Why did I come to Santiago?To avoid the damp winter in Buenos Aires because of the poor state of mybronchial passages?Or perhaps . . .384Volume 2Witold Gombrowicz chose Santiago del Estero to avoid the damp winter inBuenos Aires. It turned out shortly thereafter, however, that all this talk abouthis health was a pretext and that the real, hidden motive of his journey wasdifferent. Gombrowicz, checkmated by approaching old age, sought violentrescue and knew that if he did not establish some link with youth within thenext few years, nothing could save him. In addition, it was an urgent matter oflife or death to ﬁnd some sort of new, unknown connection with the freshness ofthat new life . . . a mad idea, because it was dictated by a perilous situation thatoffered no other way out. And at ﬁrst, it seemed to our traveler that, who knows,perhaps the most fantastic dream could come true, that is how docile and kindSantiago seemed . . . that is how easy . . . soon, however, that easiness wouldbare its teeth . . . white as they might be!

Friday, Santiago
(Witold Gombrowicz, having arrived in Santiago, succumbed to a wave ofbelated eroticism, the same as before, years ago. . . . But this time the wave wasstrengthened by the miasma of this city of Indian blood, easy beauty, and hotsun. And this wave, all the more scandalous because of its belatedness, bore himaway again into the vortex of foolishness and shame! But his mastery of thesetypes of situations (which have become his specialty, because an artist must acton the borderline between shame and foolishness) shone once again . . . when,to be exact, instead of giving himself up passively to this madness like anyordinary drunk, he took this madness in hand and took to ordering it, therebychanging intoxication into drama. This, however, happened with the help ofthe pronouncement that he, Gombrowicz, he, Doctor Faustus, had come toSantiago with the aim of concluding a great discovery, that he had ﬁnallydecided to ﬁnd a way of linking old age to youth, so that a generation that wasnearing its end could, in its twilight, draw new substance from youth, andexperience the beginning once again . . . and, who knows, friends, if it is notwithin our power to ﬁnd this mysterious key, which would allow our dying toexperience, in its farewell, a taste of new life, to link ourselves to birth! Imagine!If, at ﬁrst glance, salvation seems possible, it can be contained only in this!1958385This is a pronouncement that is probably somewhat false . . . because,just between you and me, he did not come to Santiago for this reason. Nor couldthis Faustian swagger seem like the real thing for even ﬁve minutes of hismortally-stripped-of-all-illusions sobriety. Yet he has raised this lying to the highheavens without hesitation and unfurled it above his head like a banner on thebasis of the following calculation: that, ﬁrst of all, this lying stops being a liebecause of its naive and disarming obviousness, and that, second, even thoughit is false, it contains something so real and harmonious with nature that it ismore difﬁcult to resist this mystiﬁcation than to resist many other obvioustruths. That is why, once again, he threw himself into a mad and aging attackwith the shout: ‘‘Onward toward youth! To youth! To get at it, experience it, anddestroy that barrier of age!’’)
Saturday
. . . the naked back under the whip, black head of curly hair hunched intothe shoulders, eyes glancing sideways, ears alert to the swish of the strap . . . This isthe poison that is killing me in Santiago. They have this in their blood! In theirlook. In their smile.Spears, swords, spurs, armor, the plumed helmets of the white, beardedconquerors invading the naked defenselessness of those Huries, Lules, Vilelasthree or four hundred years ago . . . And a hundred years ago? In his memoirs, Gen-eral Paz describes how in the 1840s, the governor ordered that two Indians havetheir throats cut daily. . . . These were Indians (‘‘whose eyes I often saw,’’ writes thegeneral) chosen from the heaps of rotting prisoners in the dungeon and then ledout to be slaughtered . . . sadism and masochism still play in that colored air anddance in the streets. Their stench poisons me. Such is the perversity of Santiago!Mix a little slave with the most common of cities . . . but . . . I couldbe wrong.
Sunday
Tandil! Ah, Tandil! That obsession! Santiago is like Tandil: the same four-cornered square, similar streets, and the same café, the same church, the samebank, it’s just that they are situated differently. Where in Tandil there was a Banco386Volume 2de la Provincia, here there is a Hotel Palace. I walk almost automatically to thebank and I bang my nose into: a hotel. As if I were in a Tandil that is not Tandil butsomething maliciously tangled, a trap. . . .Oh Tandil, with your cold, oceanic wind and your stone amphitheaters! . . .
(The author of Pornograﬁa is becoming obsessed with Tandil as an escape fromthe importunate and tempting horrors of Santiago.)
My friends, the minors from Tandil! Yesterday a letter came from Dipi andit is difﬁcult to express how easy it is to breathe after that letter . . . here inSantiago! . . . I include it in order to give you a sense of the tone of my relationshipwith them, one of the tones of it . . . and because what is written there, that Gize(otherwise known as ‘‘Quilombo’’) te adora (adores you), is very important to me.This Dipi (alias ‘‘Asno’’) is sixteen years old and the author of an unpublishednovel, a play (which a theater in La Plata is producing), and a few stories:
‘‘Cadaver!‘‘I was in La Plata and spoke with the director of my play. I have nottold you anything about it. It is a farce as they claim, apparently well con-structed from a theatrical point of view. In my opinion, it is too simple to beliterature. As theater it can be pleasant, but at the present time, I feel that it isof doubtful value . . . it would ﬂatter me to have it put on, but I am notsatisﬁed with it.‘‘Your epileptico-elliptic letter twisted all our necks into corkscrews.Quilombo has sworn revenge.‘‘Gize is turning things out, possessed as he is by Ferdydurke. If thiscomes out brilliantly, well, all the better! But I fear that you will turn him intoa Gombrowicz. You know that Quilombo is feverishly passionate and that headores you. He has succumbed completely to your ha! ha! ‘genius.’ Do not betaken aback by the quotation marks; I acknowledge your genius but then youknow my cynicism, my characteristic doubting, negating, poking fun . . . Imake fun of you, too (while imagining your sniggers at my expense), but it’s asif I were laughing at myself. Do you remember how we understood eachother in this, surprisingly, when you were visited by momentary weakness andwere walking so pained because of Gize’s arrest? Don’t try to squirm your wayout of this, don’t deny it! As for Gize, he moves in Polish, thinks in Polish, and1958387practically speaks Polish. He is really very ‘artistic’—perhaps even more thanyou think. He wants to divide time here into ‘pre-Witold’ and ‘post-Witold’epochs. Well, this is a slight exaggeration, though I admit I have gained agreat deal from this Witold epoch. Your sober, elemental, violent, and some-what deceitful (now don’t get upset!) criticism has taught me a lot.‘‘Write. I would like to know how you are doing. I am brutally curious.But I am also becoming more reasonable in my childhood, from which Iprefer not to abdicate as of yet. That is why I want to know what is happeningwith your expiring life. It is common sense that makes me ask, even thoughthis may appear strange . . . the point is that my common sense submits me toconvention and compels me to ask what is new with you . . . because, franklyspeaking, you yourself will understand this, I don’t really care, because Irespect you but I do not adore you. I am far from adoration à la Gize. I see thatthis passage has turned out to be quite abstruse. It’s because I am tired. Are allthose women still in love with you? Maybe you could pass one on to me, as Iam suffering from a lack of women in spite of Fuchi, Puchi, and Tuchi.‘‘It is sad that a great writer writes ‘holla’ instead of ‘olla.’ It is a greatshame and dishonor: after which you ought to keep your mouth shut for-ever! We were rolling on the ﬂoor with laughter, we and dozens of otherpeople who read your letter. Ciao! Your,Donkey’’
This donkey is named Jorge Di Paola. I christened him the donkey in anattack of sarcasm and from then on he became asno, to his friends, who were reallytickled by this name.I don’t know if I have done the right thing by including this letter. . . . 
(Why did he include it? Was it only to show that he was popular in Tandil? Butthere is clearly the more sophisticated intention of elevating himself, settinghimself apart, which could be formulated as follows: Peek-a-boo! Do you olderfolks now see how much more intimate my relations with young people are thanwith you! And how much more important to me a letter like this is, in whichthere is nothing out of the ordinary, than your most sophisticated epistolaryfeats. . . .Once again, therefore, Gombrowicz appears to us as someone who will388Volume 2in no way occupy his rightful place in society and who is always plotting withother elements, groups, and phases of development.)
Wednesday
I have read this letter many times. And I doubt that it will be understoodthat this and a few other letters from Tandil have become an escape and havenfrom Santiago. ‘‘You know that Quilombo adores you.’’ Those words sounded like aprelude to hope for me, this was youth showing itself in another, less cruel, role . . .and even in a friendly role. . . . Therefore, I said to myself, ‘‘adoration’’ is notimpossible between him and me?Quilombo, alias Gize, also called Colimba (this in folk dialect means timeserved in the army as well as ‘‘recruit’’). Our meeting was the result of casualcircumstances that were, nevertheless, deeply and movingly artistic. At ﬁrst, aweakening. When I got to know him in Tandil, in the Café Rex, I was somewhatweakened by an imminent angina attack and my sensitivity was tremulously, pain-fully tense. Second, there was his stuttering. That is: he stuttered. . . . I did not knowat the beginning what made him so likable, it was only on the second day that Iunderstood that, as a result of his stuttering, he must make a special effort to speakwhich, together with his Spanish face, alive like an adventure ﬁlm, bestowed aspecial amiability upon him.The angina attack, along with a fever reaching 40\C, kept me bedridden. Ilived alone in a small house close to Calvario, on the outskirts of town, and Iremember no more desperate days than those that accompanied my recuperation.There was no help from any quarter. I knew that nothing would save me. The dayswere rainy and windy. Through the window I could see the mountain peak torn toshreds by clouds, or perhaps it was the clouds that were torn to shreds by themountain peak. And one day was especially terrifying: it came after a whole night’sdownpour, almost unlike day at all, changed into water, cold, fog, winds, and awhite damp darkness. I could see just one dripping tree enveloped in fog, blurredand indistinct, and only that tree, dripping and monotonous. . . . That day myneurasthenic despair reached such a pitch that if I had had the means for an easydeath at hand, who knows if I would not have liquidated myself. I knew that theillness was beyond me, but I also knew that my health was worse than my illness. I1958389had reached a state in which health is no less repugnant, and perhaps even morerepugnant because it conﬁrms an existence already infected with death and there-fore condemned.Then suddenly I heard a ﬁst pounding on the kitchen door, and Colimbawalked in, dripping wet! He got through the water that had been pouring from thesky and, what’s worse, he sloshed through the street, forded his way through theslurping and sticky mud until he ﬁnally got here, ﬁghting the wind, rain, and cold,and he was cheerful! Witold, che, como estas?! His face was rich with adventure,like a ﬁlm, swinging acrobatically from seriousness to jest, from groan to joy, frompoetry to rambunctiousness, from compassion to anger, his face immediately ﬁlledthe whole room and I probably never had a stronger sense that the potential ofsomeone’s joy is not inaccessible, that one can gain access to someone’s joy, if it isyoung. That youth is something that it is possible to possess (Please don’t makestupid jokes out of this!). It is as if some sort of Wave Mechanics completed andenlarged my feeling of well-being. I felt that I was not just a concrete individual,destined for destruction, but a wave . . . a current, stretched out between the risingand setting generations. Sometimes my hopelessness is visited by a spark of con-viction, a completely palpable certainty that salvation is not impossible. This isexactly what I was feeling while Gize prepared my food and opened the bottle hehad brought.Even though neither he nor I said a word about it . . . I knew that hiscoming was the result of his great concern for me, and his adulation. . . . He hadcome because he was charmed! Enchanted! What’s more, I know that his spend-ing his precious little amount of free time with me meant that he was taking it awayfrom his girlfriend, who did not yet completely bore him. . . . How amusingtherefore: I, a man of certain age, was a stronger magnet for this young man than abeautiful girl and my charms were stronger than love! What was it in me that couldequal a young girl’s charms?The repulsive and sneering comicality of this comparison was the reason Ipreferred to think about this only with one little corner of my mind, but even thatwas enough for me to realize that this repulsiveness was the real source of deepestjoy. For when an old man looks at a young man, usually it is difﬁcult for him tounderstand that the young man can have his own tastes and needs, completelyindependent of what seems the most important and the most characteristic in him390Volume 2to the older man. It seems, for example, to that older person that only the youngcan appeal to the young, only the handsome to the handsome . . . until, suddenly, itturns out that youth likes old age instead . . . or likes some special category ofugliness . . . that, in a word, it takes a liking to something completely unpredictableand even irreconcilable with its essence (such as the older man sees it). So that, atﬁrst, it irritates and offends us, as if it were a betrayal and, what is more, some sort ofcorruption and warping of an ideal. But not long afterward we are overcome by awild joy and we begin to understand that not all is lost in such a case! So, therefore,we both push away this realization in revulsion and receive it with joy as a miracleand sign of grace.In order to gauge accurately one certain, dirty, and repugnant aspect of thisjoy, one should realize that I acted toward Gize somewhat like an old woman,delighted that his hunger outweighed his revulsion, because, in the end, certainattractive and repulsive forces were at play at the same time. . . . Yet, on the otherhand, in order to measure the entire generous splendor of this arrangement innature one must understand that no one decides about his own attractiveness andthat it is exclusively a matter of one’s taste. If I, therefore, was attractive to him, thenI was and that was that. . . . and I was, too, because I possessed a technique, style,level, horizon, and quality of which he could not even dream at his age because Iwrote books that dazzled, because with each accent, face, joke, game, I led himinto an unseen and unheard of superiority. What did it matter that I knew mymisery? I charmed him! Just one more example from the area of physics in order tomake palpable the infernal slipperiness of this conclusion: imagine yourselvesendowed with a defect, let us say you have donkey ears. Well, ﬁne, but what if yourears fascinate the princess and what if she falls in love with you because of them?What then? If you cut off the ears, which you don’t like, you will stop beingattractive to someone whom you like. What should you choose? Isn’t it moreimportant that you should appeal to someone who appeals to you rather thanappeal to yourself?And if some possibility of salvation did exist for me in all of this, didn’t itdepend on this very thing?I understood it well: my ‘‘existence’’ fascinated him, while his life in crudoappealed to me. I adored his freshness and he adored what I had made of myself,what I had become as I developed. The closer I was to death, the more he adored1958391me, because he saw all the more of my already expiring existence. Therefore ourunderstanding would have been possible only if that which is characteristic ofyouth, that which is hot and impatient, the desire to exist, if that could be ex-changed for the hunger for life that is particular to aging. . . . Exchange existencefor life? . . . Stop, perhaps there is something to this, perhaps something can bedone using this approach, think a minute, don’t let this thought get away. . . .
Thursday
(So there, in the end, a redemptive thought came to him, an exchange ofexistence [that is, a formed life, just as man had made it] for that passivelynatural life, in its young, initial phase.]This thought moved him quite perceptibly. Would it be an exaggerationto conceive of all his writing as a search for the elixir of youth? In  Ferdydurke [written when the author was not yet thirty] he had already been thrilled by theforbidden delight: that man could be created by man . . . by a younger man,right? This in itself was a way of regaining youth. In The Marriage he exploitsthis speciﬁc generosity to its core when he exhorts the younger to surrenderhimself . . . to kill himself for old age. In Pornograﬁa he is excited by the factthat youth exists for those older and vice versa.No other world needs youth as much as Gombrowicz’s world . . . andone could say that this is a world built by ‘‘taking youth into consideration.’’And if up until now he sought salvation in the violence perpetrated on theyounger by the older [The Marriage] or ﬁnally in the coordination of these twoforms of violence [Pornograﬁa], now we see him in Santiago, overcome by thethought that came to him in Tandil about the possibility of exchanging life forexistence, which simply means that two separate categories of human beingsexist and that they desire one another. . . . )
Thursday
Yes . . . but our rapprochement was, as I said earlier, a coincidence aboveall else . . . a mere coincidence. . . . If not for the stuttering and the effort to getthrough the bad weather outside . . . if he had not caught me ill . . .392Volume 2To this was added the magic of names. ‘‘Gize,’’ I like that diminutive, it wasgood for a pathetic apostrophe, I like to call out, dramatically: ‘‘Gize!’’This lent our conversations distinction and luster. On one occasion, mytongue slipped and made ‘‘Quilombo’’ out of ‘‘Colimba.’’ ‘‘Quilombo’’ means‘‘bordello’’ in Spanish, except that it is not as vulgar and can be used jokingly andmetaphorically to mean disorder, confusion, a nuthouse. Used as one’s name, itbecomes very amusing and perversely poetic. Che, Quilombo, como estas? I wouldsay with reﬁned politeness and this would establish a distance between us thatfacilitated intimacy.I could not get close to him without Form, without the structure of Form.And he (also being an artist with a passion for drawing, but at his age it was not yetclear whether this was genuine talent or mere ability) also demanded Form of me.How moving was the passage in his letter from Tandil: ‘‘Believe me . . .whenever I remember last summer . . . that house, the girls . . . your sad anginawhen a certain angelic ‘Quilombo’ took care of you . . . I get sad just reminiscingabout it.‘‘And then your move to Park Mountain and my ‘imaginary’ as you said,angina . . . and recuperation . . . our talks . . . walks in the sunlight . . . mydrawings . . . That was a summer I shall never forget. Never!’’I wrote back: ‘‘Ah, my unforgettable Quilombo! You have managed to givethese insigniﬁcant events the stature of myth and legend. . . .’’
Tuesday
My talk ‘‘Contemporary Issues’’ took place yesterday. I gave this talk out ofsheer boredom and to make contact with the intellectuals of Santiago. I did notforesee that this would end demonically.I tried to characterize current thought by saying, for example, that it is‘‘reduced,’’ that slowly it is becoming accustomed to ‘‘dual interpretation,’’ that wefeel it as something ‘‘acting not only on the outside, but also on the inside, creatingthe one who thinks.’’ I referred to science, quanta, Heisenberg and wave me-chanics. Husserl, and Marcel. My merciful God! I spoke as I always do, as even theﬁnest speakers do, that is, pretending that I was quite at home with this materialand that this is my daily bread and butter, when, in reality, any indiscreet ques-1958393tioner could have laid me ﬂat on my back. But I have grown so accustomed tomystiﬁcation! And I also know that this kind of mystiﬁcation is not scorned even bythe most prominent! I was doing my part, then, and it was coming out pretty well.Suddenly, in the audience, behind the ﬁrst row of people, I noticed a hand restingon someone’s knee. . . .Another hand, closer by and belonging to someone else, was resting on orwas hooked by the ﬁngers to the back of a chair . . . and suddenly it was as if the twopalms had grabbed me, until I was terriﬁed, until I began to choke . . . and so againthe body in me spoke up. But I looked closer: the hands belonged to students whohad come from Tucumán and that calmed me down immediately. I had a vision ofTandil, I knew there was no reason to be afraid, these were well-wishing, friendlyhands. I looked around the auditorium once again, all of the hands were friendlyand, although corporeal, they were nevertheless at the service of the Spirit, thesewere hands belonging to intellectuals. . . . This thicket of spiritualized hands didwonders for me. It was probably the ﬁrst time in my life that I lost that portion ofacting, bluster, artiﬁce that had clamped onto my spirit. Suddenly, the seriousnessand essence of my work as a teacher outweighed all my dishonesty. I understoodthe meaning of my assignment; it was something a great deal more important thana professorial lecture, than ‘‘cultural work,’’ or an artistic or literary showing off. Iwas ﬁghting for myself here, trying to draw them out of their ﬂesh and transformthem into existence. My fate depended on how much I could win them over andforce them to the spirit, for that was the only thing that could save me! I began tospeak with such passion that I listened to myself in disbelief, it was so real. . . .A discussion followed: but their timid and moved voices were only a spring-board for my metaphysical one. I was so strong that for the ﬁrst time in my life Iunderstood what a force I could be if I could believe in myself, the way the saintsand the prophets had. Finally one young man rose and expressed his gratitude, andthen others came up to me. It was obvious that I was not being thanked for myintellect but for something more important: for ﬁghting the body, corporeality,physicality. . . . I asked for a glass of water. Everyone rushed to fulﬁll my wish. In amoment a chango came in with a carafe on a tray. I went mute, terriﬁed. Thatchango . . .But the body of that illiterate was so decent . . . it was decency itself . . . thiscommon, calm, freely living, easy-moving, quiet body was sincerity, morality . . .394Volume 2and so much so and so completely that compared to this the meeting sounded likea shrill note, like a high-pitched squeal . . . I don’t know. . . . The blessed simplicityof a chest, or perhaps the moving honesty of a neck, and the hands that can barelytrace letters, rough and real from physical labor . . . My spirit gave up its ghost. Acomplete ﬂop. I tasted lipstick on my lips.In the meantime, the Indian (because he had a lot of this blood in him)poured water for me with the careful movement of a slave, with his hands sum-moned into being to serve, devoid of pride, but also of meaning. The quieter hishands were, the more terrifying their explosion, because that chango, like everyservant, was a quantité négligeable, ‘‘air,’’ and it was exactly because of this, becauseof his negligibility, that he became a phenomenon from another register, andoverwhelming in that margin of his. His unimportance, cast into the periphery,there, became important! I said good-bye and left. I did not want to prolong mybeing alone with the chango. Out on the street it was dark. Santiago’s colorfulsunset went out and the violent cold of the winter, which appeared right after thedisappearance of the sun, forced me to put on my coat. I was still exchangingparting niceties with persons who were seeing me off, when the chango . . . walkedby, just a few feet away from me.Was this the same chango? Was this him? They were all alike . . . so muchso that you could substitute one for another, almost identical one. . . . Therefore, Iwas inclined to believe that this was a different one, a brother, colleague, compan-ion . . . but did this make any difference? He walked slowly in the direction of theriver, Río Dulce. I followed him. I followed him because it was absurd and un-thinkable that I, Gombrowicz, would follow some chango just because he wassimilar to the chango who had poured water for me. But once again his perfectunimportance exploded, like a thunderclap, in the margin of everything thatpasses for important. And I followed him, as if it were my most holy obligation!I walked on, uneasy. . . . Because I had long given up these walks in theRetiro and along the Leandro Alem (about which I have written before), and now,in Santiago, this situation, the deepest, most essential, and most painful of all ofmine, returned again unexpectedly: I was following a village boy. This time, how-ever, there was a new slant to the situation, namely, that it was neither beauty noryouth that was at stake but morality. I walked, led astray by that other honesty,simplicity, purity, which was undermining and destroying my spiritualization. I1958395walked after his plain back, visible neck, calm hand! And my recent triumphevaporated, poof! it was gone! . . . Yet while I greeted with despair this new marchof mine into defeat, I decided, gritting my teeth, that now I would ﬁnally ﬁnd asolution to this problem . . . any solution . . . this could not go on any longer. Thishad to be done away with. And I believed, I don’t know exactly why, maybebecause of the intensity with which the body imposed itself on me, that if I wascapable of solving the physical shape of the event, if I could ﬁnd the physicalsolution to the situation, then that would also lead me to a spiritual solution. At anyrate (as long as it lasted), I walked after that chango in the dusk, aware that mywalking after him was, ﬁrst of all, the formula of the situation: I and he, I walkingafter him, I with him . . . we are a problem to solve. . . .Somehow the problem was growing . . . with that peculiar power withwhich certain meaningless things swell. This unexpected procession was ringingin my ears, pounding at my temples! Theoretically, I knew why the body before mewas so honest, in contrast to the perversity that characterized us intellectuals. Thetransparency of the body! The honesty of the body! Because the body created asimple and radiant game of needs and values, and for that chango, a value wassomething that satisﬁed his physical needs, the normal needs of a healthy body, sothat he was really the passive playground of natural forces. He was nothing morethan nature and that is why he shone before me in the dark: pure, simple, andlucent. Moral like a dog, like a horse! Moral like everyday health! And I? And thoselike me? Oh, we broke with the logic of the body and were a product of compli-cated factors, deriving not from nature in general anymore, but from speciﬁchuman nature, we, a product of humanity, a product of this ‘‘second nature’’ that isthe nature of humanity. We were perversity, reﬁnement, and complication, wewere the Spirit, oh, unhappy ones! . . . Yet I could not agree to this situation, that Iwas following him, I, in adoration . . . this would be equal to complete failure. . . .Tearing myself away by force, therefore, I turned into the ﬁrst street on the left. Ibroke contact and now I was walking alone. . . . I told myself, shaken up: The hellwith it! Don’t forget who you are! He is only a meaningless body, one of the manyon the compost heap! You are indispensable, singular, original, irreplaceable!But the fact that, bodily, I was not as honest or as transparent as he carried aweight that was so absolute that I sang hymns of praise to myself in vain. They werespiced with bitterness and a putrid smell rose from me. I felt on that empty street396Volume 2that there was no helping it, I had to murder something. I continued to walk, set oncommitting murder. I had to reduce him to the level of an animal and remainalone in my humanity. I was not allowed to tolerate my dual humanity anymore,his or mine. Either I had to become a monster or he an animal. There was no otherway out. . . . This obvious truth was accompanied by another: that I should notleave him and allow him to be alone, in secret. I decided, therefore, to catch upwith him and have it out. What if he had gotten too far away. No, it was almostcertain that, having gotten to the park, he would have turned right, walked alongthe street parallel to mine, but I imagined to myself that I was catching up to himand that I was following him again. . . . No, that would be for naught! Comingupon him from the side, from around the corner, would not be satisfying. . . . Idecided to quicken my pace so that I would come out ahead of him, face-to-face, atthe next intersection. . . . And that thought dazzled me! Not from behind, not fromthe side, but face-to-face!Not from behind.Not from the side.But straight at him, head-on, face-to-face! Such was the physical formulafor victory. This allowed for the attack. And I needed this war with him, because itmade him my enemy, it put him on the outside. I set off almost running, and therunning itself, having him in view, changed the situation to my advantage. I turnedviolently. I slowed my steps. Now I walked along a street with sparse street lamps.One side of the street was formed by the great, black, quiet trees of the park. Andthen he approached me, still at a substantial distance, dissolved in the lights of theswaying lamps. He was getting closer, and my hostility was expelling him out of melike a rash, there he was in front of me. Kill. I honestly wanted to kill him. And Iwas killing him in myself with my wanting to kill him. In the certainty that withoutthis murder, I would never be capable of being moral. My morality became aggres-sive and murderous. The distance between us quickly decreased. I, naturally, didnot intend to kill him ‘‘externally.’’ I merely wanted to murder him in him and Iwas certain that if I killed him, then even I could believe in God, at any rateI would be on God’s side. . . . This was one of those moments in my life in which Iunderstood that morality is wild . . . wild. . . . Then . . . when we came abreast ofeach other, he greeted me, smiling:—Que tal?1958397I knew him! He was one of the shoeshine boys that milled around thesquare. He had polished my shoes a few times. An acquaintance! I had not beenready for this! The murderous encounter fell to pieces. . . . I nodded to him andshouted back, Adonde vas? We passed each other and out of this frenzy, nothingremained except the everyday and the ordinary, as the highest tone, as the king ofthe entire event!
(Therefore he experienced catastrophe once again. Again that accursed pedes-trianism tore through, just when he had his drama organized, and once againeverything disintegrated in his hands, as if ‘‘the other’’ simply had not wanted toplay . . . and our Faust got bogged down in the everyday. They sure made a foolof him! The drama was taken away from him, the drama that was his onlyornament in this battle with the younger set. . . .But from this unconsummated encounter there will remain with him,probably to the very end, the growing conviction that virtue has claws andknows how to murder, that the moral and spiritual world is subject to theuniversal law of cruelty. In spite of all efforts, the gap between ﬂesh and thespirit grows smaller and smaller, they penetrate each other and harness oneanother, these worlds. . . .And this is what he had learned in sun-blessed Santiago.)3981959

Every lawyer, otherwise known as ‘‘the patron,’’ basks in the high-ﬂownconviction of his own ‘‘cultural well-roundedness’’ (because, of course, ‘‘law edu-cates’’), and any old hydraulic engineer considers himself a full-ﬂedged scholar,like Heisenberg. It is almost not worth mentioning that when it comes to theimagination, they haven’t the least notion of what it is.Yesterday. How irritating! For two whole hours I had to bear the conceit ofboth these species of pseudo-intellectuals-with-diplomas. Incredible stupidity. Theattorney with his little lawyer’s ‘‘look,’’ his worldview, style, form reeking of thatpitiful university, just the way a suit reeks of mothballs. . . . His engineershipproclaimed the superiority of the hard sciences, because, man, those there philo-sophical or artistic romances are not for a disciplined mind and ‘‘have you gentle-men heard of quanta?’’ The level was appalling. And each of them was furnishedand supplemented by a better half who adored his intellect with real feminineecstasy. It is a sad fact that each year the universities produce thousands of thesejackasses and that sooner or later they ﬁnd their unfailing she-ass complements.How is one to prevent the higher institutions of learning from producingsuch rubbish and from polluting the air in the civilized world? The air around meis getting thick with young cretins of university fabrication, laundered of all naturalintelligence. South America, too, is ﬁlling the air with a stiﬂing student populace1959399that knows only what is crammed into its head. Stuffed with information, it has lostall sense of the imponderables: character, reason, poetry, and grace. The coarseugliness of these intellectual workers, specialists in medicine, law, technology, etc.,even here in Argentina, is getting annoying. People who are insensitive to art,unfamiliar with life, and formed by abstraction are conceited and ponderous. I liketo whip these unaesthetic idiots into a fury or drown them in the chaos of namesand theories invented on the spot—oh, they may even beat me up one day! I amamused that these coarse natures sentenced exclusively to science consider all else,anything beyond the sciences, all of the spiritual life of the human tribe, as nothingbut the pulling of someone’s leg—the consequence of which is that they are indeathly fear of having someone pull their leg.I take great pleasure in stoking their peasant distrust of the ‘‘writer,’’ thatjokester par excellence, and occasionally I assume a mien or drop an altogetherdubious or sometimes even quite comic word. Their simple respect for seriousnessis so great that they are struck dumb. Or I attack them with aristocracy andgenealogy, a foolproof trick when it comes to driving imbeciles into completeimbecility.Ah yes . . . the aristocracy . . . ah yes . . . the aristocracy. O aristocracy,perhaps you are something more than a malicious joke. The idol of the people isutility, and the idol of the aristocracy is pleasure. To be useful and unpleasant—isthe goal of every robot and specialist. To be so useful as to be able to be unpleasant—is their dream. The dream of aristocrats is the diametrical opposite: to be sopleasant as to be able to be useless. As for me, I claim and record this as one of thecanons of my knowledge of human nature: he who wants to please people haseasier access to humanity than he who merely wishes to be a useful servant.

I was walking along a path, across a large meadow in the forests of Santiago;the terrain seemed to be marked for construction, overgrown with sparse grass,white bald hillocks of sand, uninteresting. I was walking along slowly, lost inthought, looking at the ground, the sun had already set. I walked by rubble ofscattered bricks and bits and pieces of machines and boxes when all of a suddenthe path rose under my feet, not much, just a little, as a result of a light swelling ofthe ground—and immediately fell. This was enough. I felt that the earth had hitme from below with a wave, I felt her undulation, her unexpected, hidden re-silience. Stop! What was this?! Had the path come alive? Had the earth comealive? Stop, stop, for goodness sake, is it possible for objects to come alive . . . butthen you would have to become a lifeless object, irreversibly! How’s that? How’s that?Three stones on the path riveted my gaze, one next to the other. . . . Is anotherinterpretation of the cosmos—in which their lifelessness would become life andmy life, death—possible? No, away with this thought, this is stretching things a bit,making them too fantastic, but listen, if in addition to the living world and thelifeless world, some sort of third world existed—a third principle—oh! of which wehaven’t even dreamed, assuring action to an object, transforming an object into asubject? To conceive of these three little stones as alive . . . Would an active inertiabe possible? Oh stop! What nonsense! . . .All of this because you are a bright boy. That is why there is no nonsenseyou can’t swallow . . . intelligence and imagination surrender you to stupidity,because nothing is fantastic enough for you . . . and you stand on the path as if ledastray by some nonsense, which in a thousand years—in a thousand years, oh, youson of the millennia—is ready to become a thing related to the truth.1959401Monday
one fat wet dog. A characteristic statement by a high ofﬁcial. ComradeMinister of Culture and Art said on the radio (December 1958):
‘‘There is something abnormal in today’s situation. Let us take a random exam-ple: Gombrowicz’s book is a literary tidbit reviewed by all of our publicationsand not just once, but many times, while books for the mass reader are notreviewed at all.’’
Then, a moment later, in the same dialogue about ‘‘cultural’’ politics, asthey often say on Polish Radio, Comrade Minister again returns to the sameobsessive theme:
‘‘Considering how little available space there is in the press, for example, thefact that Gombrowicz is reviewed twenty-ﬁve times and Wanda Melcer not evenonce has much to do with the politics of culture.’’
I see. This is an obsession all right. And already an indication of a very strictdiet. The idyll is over.Now, there’s a ﬁne ballet! What a shame that my colleagues in the West areignorant of this two-step with their own nations—one step forward, one step back.For ten years you are nothing, for two years prominent, after which a writer, by dintof their cultural ordinances, becomes the author of ‘‘literary tidbits,’’ and not at allbad ones at that.This ‘‘at that’’ disturbs me the most. Perhaps I would prefer them to pre-serve a wild and absolute silence about me forever, as was the case not too longago, to burn me at the stake or drown me in the toilet. Art, like faith, is afraid of justone thing: the lukewarm. But they—culturally. With a plan. Oh sure, you canpraise a little, lest it look like terror . . . but not too much. This kills ‘‘a little bit,’’ likepoison in small doses, released slowly.

Recalling my numerous fears, I come to the conclusion that my poorresistance or, simply stated, my cowardice—which makes getting into an elevatordifﬁcult and appears when I get on a tram, the cowardice which poisons my life—stems from that feature (or perhaps mannerism) of my imagination that causes mysuffering to appear most often in some sort of inferior, diminutive aspect. For me,‘‘I am choking’’ is not the moment when my lungs are bursting but when therebegins to be not enough air—but for good. I am ready to compare a back painwhen one cannot change position to a broken leg, and the taste of yesterday’s tea, ablister on the ﬁnger, or darkness to war. Such vision undercuts courage the waypests fell a tree.What can fear have in common with innocence? Yet for me, maximalhorror is something as pure as . . . maximal innocence.one yellow dog, a little gnawed on but new.

The New Year 1959 in Tandil. From here, from the beautiful villa of theMauros where I live like a king, spoiled by their hospitality, I watch ﬁreworksbursting over the city, nestled in a dell.

How little I have written this past year! A little of the diary. A little Operetta, which I have stopped writing again. Oh well! Inﬁrmity! I am still not in the best ofhealth, although Zellner has been able to put me back on my feet.What am I supposed to do? Let us make a list—this may interest those whoare interested in me. . . . (The blurring of the perspective as a result of my growingfame: I have lost the former, clear distinction between that which is boring in mywriting and that which is interesting, because now something boring can be inter-esting simply because it concerns me; this is how the growing ‘‘I’’ engendersconfusion. . . .)1959403So let us make a list.Complete this segment of the Diary.Finish the second act of Operetta, introducing the plot line ‘‘mother slut,’’and strengthening the parts of Firulet and Charmant.Go over the French translation of the Diary. Letter to Suzanne Arlet.Correspondence. Janusz, Kot, Alicia Giangrande, Giedroy´ c, Preuves, Kos-zella, etc., Alice de Barcza.Go over the Heidegger notes, in connection with the fourth talk to the club‘‘Amigos del Arte.’’A telegram to the ´Swieczewskis.Prepare the radio texts.Correspondence with publishers.The French translation of Ivona (get it moving). I have no idea—whetherthis list is boring or interesting.

He doesn’t know! This is how corrupting the weight of his burgeoning ‘‘I’’ hasbecome—and this growing ‘‘I’’ is muddling his relationship with the world moreand more. Outside of the physical illness which he mentions to justify why hewrote so little, there is the other inﬁrmity which is even more painful: he reallydoes not know what to do with the Gombrowicz who appears to him from timeto time in foreign newspapers, already quite international, European, already(almost) cosmopolitan. An inﬁrmity all the more humiliating because this kindof trouble is so typically Gombrowiczian—what is more his, as a theme andproblem, than the burgeoning of his personality inﬂated with fame? Yet it isexactly this that increases his feebleness—because this obligates—and it is notappropriate for him to set off on well-trodden paths with an issue so verypersonal, so lived through, he must ﬁnd his own solution here to the question of‘‘how to be great?’’ he should give a completely singular answer. Well, certainly!He will not, of course, resort to well-known ‘‘solutions’’ of the famous and glibgreats; not for him, for example, the affected mastery of Anatole France . . . yetDostoevski’s greatness, simple and rustic, sly but passionate, is also useless . . .after all, it is completely alien to him. And what of Goethe’s Olympus! Erasmusor Leonardo? Tolstoy from Yasnaya Polyana? Jarry’s metaphysical dandyism or404Volume 2Lautréamont? Titian or Poe? Kierkegaard or Claudel? No, none of this, none ofthese masks, none of these scarlet cloaks. . . . One has to create somethingof one’s own . . . except that greatness is an old wh— — —e, and one of the unfail-ing lures of art, so it has already been used a hundred times, in various ver-sions. Greatness that is pathetic and humble, clownish and cynical, zealousand brutal, Christian—pagan—lyrical—and dry—and mathematical—is wellknown. . . . but each of these timeworn odalisques danced in her own way.Of all these styles of greatness, proposed by so many masters, the closestto him was perhaps the one that Thomas Mann worked out for himself in thecourse of his long career. For Mann was able—in the spirit of his epoch—to link,better than anyone else, greatness to illness, genius to decadence, superiority todegradation, distinction to shame. He approached that mad harnessing ofopposites with a sincerity that aroused trust . . . and at the same time, he treatedthis shameful contradiction not as something deserving revulsion and condem-nation but as something passionate and intoxicating and so worthy of love thatthe great artist in Mann’s rendition is repulsive and ridiculous, but also mar-velous and attractive . . . like a lover. This ‘‘justice’’ of Mann’s in arranging lightand shadow, this profound intelligence in grasping the problem, appealed toGombrowicz more than he could say and in conversations he would often referto Mann and to the very lovely contours of the story ‘‘Tonio Kröger,’’ in whichhe, Gombrowicz, quickly recognized his fate and vocation. As years passed,however, it became even clearer to him that Mann’s honesty, integrity, andopenness were just one more form of coquetry and one more way of forcing—under the guise of honesty and even humility—others to acknowledge his ownright to glory. Indeed, this unmasker of dirt and poverty exploded and revealed,as it turned out, only in order to furnish himself with a more solid, durablemonument grounded more ﬁrmly in reality and awareness. And more and moreclearly could one hear in proportion to the growing of Mann’s work, behind thatunmasking iconoclasm of the revolutionary, a ponderous rhetoric, enamored ofstateliness, wheedling with its mastery, majestic, and purple as a cardinal. Ah,Mann, you old strumpet! So this is the coquet you are?!What should Gombrowicz have done then? Could he have, leaning onMann, conquered him—become a new Mann, a more advanced Mann? Moremodern by one generation? In short, was Gombrowicz supposed to play, inregard to Mann, exactly the role that Mann had played in relation to his1959405forerunners—should he have ruined Mann’s greatness dialectically in order tofound a new one on a higher level of consciousness? Our candidate for masterwas not deprived of merits that could have ensured him instant success in thisregard; he had a new honesty at his disposal, and even a new shamelessness—resulting from his slogans that pronounced an eternal breach between man andhis form and, as a consequence, allowed one to approach these extreme issueswith an ease probably unmet with until that day. He could, for example, havedescribed in his diary his own coming into prominence, his entering history,transforming himself from an unknown minor author into a personality, as if itweren’t about him, as if this triumph were merely the imposition of a new andnot very comfortable ‘‘form’’—‘‘made for him,’’ and even warping him. To be-come great? How’s that? What does one feel? How is it that man divides himselfin two and which of these persons is real? He could show (burying Mann) thatgreatness is always inauthentic, that man is incapable of realizing himself in ahigher dimension, even if his talent is really deserving of fame and admiration.Confessing to all of the pettiness of his greatness with a completely unheard-ofinsolence, boring, tormenting, irritating with his growing, he could change hisconfessions into a ﬁrst-class literary scandal, and himself into a freakish clownof greatness. Which, actually, would be completely in keeping with his philoso-phy of form and would probably ensure him a fairly original place in the historyof twentieth-century culture.Certainly—an interesting and attractive assignment! Because this didnot mean at all that he should ascetically scorn greatness—on the contrary, thisallowed him to surrender himself to it with all his greed, caress himself withhis greatness, intoxicate himself, pride himself on it—because the minute hestopped identifying with his greatness and began treating it as something thatjust happened to him, it lost its intimate and timid character. Self-advertisementwas also allowed, for in expounding on these subjects it was impossible to avoidit and this ultimately was also pleasant and even convenient. Gombrowicz wasnot so naive as to be blind to the unusual artistic advantages of this so free andpublic intimacy with greatness—for the reader likes glory, prefers a story aboutkings, princes, or great artists; shoemakers or petty clerks interest him but little,he is an aristocrat in his daydreams and, as we have already said, greatness, thatold who— — —e, or rather courtesan, is a very effective lure and constitutes the sexappeal of older gentlemen in laurel wreaths.406Volume 2one cold dog in springtime.  Gombrowicz could then really amelio-rate his preoccupation with Mann—on the one hand compromising greatnesseven more; on the other, surrendering to it with an immeasurably greater shame-lessness and without that ‘‘masterly’’ pomposity that became Mann’s weakness.But something got in the way . . . what was it? To begin with, in actual practice(that is, when our author took to realizing this program in his Diary by includ-ing, at ﬁrst, slight and restrained remarks about his fame), it turned out that theconvention forbidding the writer ‘‘self-praise’’ and pronouncing this type ofinformation ‘‘boring’’ is exceptionally difﬁcult to dismiss—much more difﬁcultthan if it were a matter of Gombrowicz’s usual carrying on about himself(which also aroused considerable resistance). Why did people react so very nega-tively? It should have been just the opposite. Success, glory, acclaim, growingprestige—this is a tasty triﬂe; the average reader adores such glories in novelsimagined from beginning to end, therefore why not in a real diary, having to dowith someone’s real destiny, someone’s autobiography? Instead they reactedwith anger, revulsion, boredom, even genuine embarrassment . . . as if the readerdid not really want to hear about all that.Stranger still was that the reader’s dislike was conﬁrmed by the innerunwillingness of the author—an unwillingness that was also unjustiﬁed, at oddswith the reserves of spiritual freedom at his disposal. Nevertheless this wasresistance . . . some sort of unhappiness with himself, similar sometimes to pangsof conscience, and sometimes even to regret . . . bitterness, and boredom, and evendispleasure or pain advised don’t take this on, leave it alone, don’t interfere—letit be. . . . What was going on? Where did this difﬁculty come from? This protestwas not born of intellectual criticism, how much more spontaneous it was . . . itwas as if he, in destroying his greatness, destroyed his own youthful dream abouthimself and as if he were liquidating this beloved, youthful ‘‘project’’ concerninghis own future. Here, therefore, something very personal, lyrical, intimate, stoodin the way, something connected with—watch out!—youth and something al-most as shameful as love. The situation was becoming scabrous and painful. . . .This was not an intellectual problem, this was something from another realm, ofthe religious perhaps, or perhaps of love. . . . Love? Youth? Was it possible thatthe true interpretation of this complex of old men called greatness had eludedMann, even though he was saturated with Freud’s ideas and closer to Freud thanto Schopenhauer? And if so . . . what was it that had remained unsaid?1959407—Good—thought Gombrowicz—good . . . the Master in Mann is at-tractive to a pupil. A pupil ‘‘loves’’ his master. If in an early phase of develop-ment the ordinary is attractive, enthralling, then the extraordinary, that whichis outstanding, becomes alluring in the later phase. . . . If this is so, if theextraordinary is attractive, why does it reveal itself only as strength—not asweakness? Because—and this is a truth one should not forget—only weaknessand inadequacy are enthralling, never power and perfection. And it is true thatFreud and Mann knew how to extract all of the biological poverty accompany-ing greatness, those deviations, the sicknesses of a great man, but what deter-mines greatness in him, genius, talent, the Olympian spark, the ﬂame of Sinai,this is powerful in them, priding itself on all the glories of Perfection andBlossoming. . . .But this does not correspond to the truth (he thought further). Inade-quacy is not something that accompanies greatness, superiority; it is its ‘‘quid,’’its substance. Greatness—let us say this at last—is inadequacy!Madman! Madman! He’s gotten on his hobbyhorse again! His face,poring over the sheet of paper, has assumed a dramatic concentration, hesought something, something that perhaps was too elusive . . . and perhaps histruth was contained in the pursuit and not in the attainment. . . . Ah, howtransparently and efﬁciently all of this shaped up for him in theory: who wasthis so-called great man if not the product of unceasing effort, of an artiﬁcialengorgement of maturity, of the diligent covering up of his deﬁciencies, of theforced adjustment to other outstanding people who allowed themselves thesame mendacity—and is not greatness an ‘‘interhuman’’ creation like all ofculture? In that case he who in the sphere of collective life succumbed to beingelevated always had to be below . . . and it is here that greatness, distinction,dignity, and mastery became insufﬁcient, immature . . . secretly afﬁliated witheverything young. . . . Mastery therefore was eternal tawdriness! An eternalfeebleness and charm! Yes! But if this were so, why couldn’t he, Gombrowicz,ﬁnd a practical counterpart for this theory, why did this thought become un-bearable when he tried to bring it to life in the pages of the Diary?It became more and more apparent to our candidate for master thathis formulas did not exhaust the practical meaning of these matters . . . anempty, perhaps ‘‘erroneous,’’ perhaps even mutually contradictory meaning. . . .My good God, who will ﬁnd the right word for the ineluctable, the elusive408Volume 2thought! . . . And it became more and more evident that one cannot showtoo much of the curtain in a show in which one is appearing—here the playwas too passionate, the coquetry was too real, important . . . elementary . . .engulﬁng. . . .He sought. He looked around for some sort of ‘‘solution.’’ But for thetime being, he resigned from a frontal attack on these difﬁcult issues in theDiary, and from ﬁnding his own new genre of greatness. He decided to wait . . .to take a closer look at this greatness of his and to determine which kind wouldultimately be awarded to him: a difﬁcult aristocratic greatness, incomprehen-sible to the throng, destined for a narrow group of initiates, or a more popularvariety? . . . The only thing he could manage for the time being was theintroduction of a ‘‘second voice’’ into the Diary —the voice of a commentator and biographer—which allowed him to speak of himself as ‘‘Gombrowicz,’’through someone else’s lips. This was, in his opinion, an important discovery,intensifying the immeasurably cold artiﬁciality of his admissions, which alsoallowed for greater honesty and passion. And this was something new, which hehad never encountered in any of the diaries he had read.An interesting innovation, of course. And perhaps more important thanit might seem. Gombrowicz had been noticing for some time that great style isnot just great, it pokes you in the ribs endlessly, whispering: ‘‘watch out, don’tmiss me, I’m great.’’ A great style possesses its own master of ceremonies, lecturerand commentator. In addition, this division into voices was justiﬁed by the verystructure of style and ﬁrmly grounded in reality. But beyond this—what wealthto be able to speak about oneself in the ﬁrst and third persons simultaneously!For he who speaks of himself with ‘‘I’’ must, of necessity, lie a lot and leave muchunsaid—while he who speaks of himself with ‘‘he’’ and tries to describe himselffrom the outside will also be wielding only a partial truth. This switching fromthe ‘‘I’’ to ‘‘Gombrowicz’’ could gradually (in proportion to the perfecting anddeepening of this device) lead to interesting results.And it permitted him to praise and unmask himself in one stroke!
Monday
A soccer match at the stadium Rio de la Plata. About thirty thousand spec-tators. Warm sun. Suddenly, over stands alive with conversation during the restless1959409wait for the beginning of battle, a little balloon appears. . . . A balloon? Everyoneknows that it is not a balloon but a condom, enormously blown up with someone’sindecent breath. The condom-balloon, aided by the currents radiating into the airfrom the heated audience, glides overhead, and when it falls, it is batted back up bythe insigniﬁcant palms of jokers . . . and the thousands present are riveted to thisﬂying scandal, so horribly visible, so offensive! Silence. No one dares say a word.Ecstasy. Then some padre de familia, furious, jabs it with a penknife. It bursts.Whistles! Howls! An incredible fury shoots out from all sides—near andfar—and terriﬁed, the ‘‘head of the family’’ bolts for the nearest exit. This was toldto me by Flor de Quilombo alias Florquilo alias Quiloﬂor alias Coliﬂor alias Flor-en-coli alias Coli-en-ﬂor.

Tuesday
The average educated Argentinean knows well that his creativity is deﬁ-cient.—We don’t have a great literature. Why? Why is there a dearth of geniusesamong us? The anemia of our music, philosophy, the plastic arts, lack of ideas,people? Why? Why? It is listless and dull. Why? Why? It is barren and passive.Why? Why? . . . And here the prescriptions begin to multiply: —We live by theborrowed light of Europe. That’s the reason. We have to break with Europe, andﬁnd within ourselves the slumbering Indian of four centuries ago . . . that is ouronly source! But the nationalism of another faction is repulsed by the very thought—what, Indio? Never! Our incapacity derives from our having moved away frommother-Spain and mother-church. Here, though, the atheism of the progressiveleft gets feverish, Spain, the clergy, yuck, obscurantism, oligarchy, learn fromMarx, you will become creative! . . . while a young man, ﬁno, from downtownBuenos Aires, returning from a tea at Victoria Ocampo’s, carries a Parisian revueand an ornate volume of Chinese poetry.Pills to cure impotence—ridiculous, thus it amazes me a bit that thisdiscussion has been going on solemnly for decades and has even transformed itselfinto the main intellectual controversy of Latin America. It is the subject of endlesslectures and articles. Believe in the Most High and Catholic Isabella and you will410Volume 2be creative! Implement a dictatorship of the proletariat and the cult of the Indian—and you will see how things improve! But this whining isn’t too serious; they needgeniuses in the way they need a soccer team—to win a match with foreign coun-tries. The undoing of their spirit is exactly this desire to show the world, to keep upwith it. The main concern of these artists is not the expression of their own passionsand the building of their own world, but to write a novel ‘‘of European stature’’—inorder for Argentina, for South America, ﬁnally to have a presentable work. Theytreat art like an international sports championship and they worry for hours aboutwhy there are so few goals for the Argentine team.Why are there so few goals? Isn’t ‘‘we’’ the problem, that little word ‘‘we’’(which I distrust so profoundly, which I would forbid the individual man to use)?As long as an Argentinean speaks in the ﬁrst person singular, he is human, supple,real . . . and perhaps in certain respects, even superior to the European. Thesmaller the ballast, the smaller the hereditary burden, the less history, tradition,custom, and thereby more freedom of movement and greater possibility for choice;it is easier then to keep up with history. And this advantage would be absolute ifSouth American life were not easy, discouraging effort, boldness, risk and persis-tence, categorical decisions, tragedy and struggle, any extremity that is the ‘‘creat-ing’’ arena par excellence. A soft life softens (why be hard?) . . . everything dissi-pates. . . . Yet in spite of his lack of intensity, the Argentinean, as long as heexpresses himself in the ﬁrst person, is someone who is not at all stupid, open to theworld and sober—and I slowly learned to like and appreciate him. Argentineansoften have grace, elegance, style.Unfortunately, this ‘‘I’’ functions only on the lowest rungs of local exis-tence. They do not know how to get it onto a higher rung—that is, into culture, art,religion, morality, philosophy—here they always switch to ‘‘we.’’ But ‘‘we’’ is anabuse. Why, the individual exists in order to use ‘‘I’’! This foggy, abstract, andarbitrary ‘‘we,’’ therefore, deprives them of concreteness, that is, their sanguine-ness; it ruins their directness, almost knocks them off their feet and puts them in ahaze. Then the Argentinean begins to preach about how, let us say, ‘‘we’’ needhistory because we cannot hold a candle to the other—more historical—nations,and he willfully begins to fabricate a history for himself by erecting monuments tocountless national heroes on every street corner, by celebrating a different anniver-sary every week, by giving lectures, often pompously, and by talking himself into an1959411illustrious past. In South America, fabricating history is an enterprise consumingcolossal amounts of (wasted) time. If he is a writer, the Argentinean will begin toconsider what Argentina really is—in order to deduce from this what sort of Argen-tinean he is supposed to be—and what his works should be like so that they turn outsufﬁciently familiar, national, continental, creole. These analyses will not neces-sarily produce a novel that ﬁts into gaucho literature; they could also produce avery sophisticated work—but inevitably written according to this program. In otherwords, this deduced Argentinean will create a deduced literature, poetry, music, adeduced worldview, deduced moral principles, and a deduced standard . . . so thateverything ﬁts snugly into his deduced Argentina.In the meantime, what is this Argentina like—what sort of ‘‘we’’ is this? Noone knows. If an Englishman or a Frenchman says ‘‘we,’’ that means somethingsometimes because in those countries people have known for centuries whatFrance or England is. But Argentina? The mixture of races and legacies, the briefhistory, unformed character, unestablished institutions, ideals, principles, reﬂexes,a splendid country, it is true, with an abundant future but certainly not formed. IsArgentina chieﬂy its natives, who have lived here for a long time? Is it chieﬂy theimmigration that is transforming and building the country? Is Argentina preciselythis: a combination, cocktail, mixture and ferment? Is Argentina Undeﬁnability?In which case that whole Argentine questionnaire—‘‘Who are we?’’ ‘‘Which truthis our truth?’’ ‘‘What are we striving for?’’—has to end in ﬁasco. For it is notintellectual analyses, but action—action based ﬁrmly on the ﬁrst person singular—that contains the answer.Do you want to know who you are? Don’t ask. Act. Action will delineateand deﬁne you. You will ﬁnd out from your actions. But you must act as an ‘‘I,’’ asan individual, because you can be certain only of your own needs, inclinations,passions, necessities. Only this kind of action is direct and is a genuine extricatingof yourself from chaos, self-creation. As for the rest: isn’t it mere recitation, execu-tion of a preordained plan, rubbish, kitsch?There is nothing easier than to allow oneself a handful of paradoxes, smack-ing of the most sober realism. For example: an authentic Argentinean will be bornwhen the writers forget about Argentina . . . when they forget about America! Theywill tear away from Europe when Europe stops being an issue for them, when theylose sight of it; its essence will reveal itself to them when they stop looking for it.412Volume 2It is absurd to think that a national identity can be realized from a predeter-mined program—it must be unforeseen. Just as personality is determined on anindividual scale. To be someone is to inquire incessantly about who I am and not toknow in advance. It is impossible to extract creativity from that which already is; itis not a consequence. . . .
Wednesday
However, one could also apply a different method, quite the opposite andcloser to what they practice today. It would consist of openly discussing all theseconcerns (impotence, lack of originality, dependence on other cultures), of seeingthem as the subject in order to gain a little distance, to break with them. Similarly,someone who is shy, by speaking of his shyness, can free himself from it, because itis no longer him—it is merely a problem. I know this method well and haverecommended it often.Certainly. But this would have to be presented not collectively but in theﬁrst person. ‘‘I,’’ ‘‘my concern,’’ ‘‘my solution.’’ No Argentinean will ask, however:Why is it that I am not creative? Their question is: Why can’t we create? Everythingdissolves in the ‘‘we.’’
Thursday
The awful invasion of stereotypes, theories, abstractions, readymade formsworked out somewhere else, is a result of their ‘‘I’’ being barely able to stand on itsown feet. The invasion is all the more grotesque because abstraction is not in theirnature. There is something painful about their need to theorize and their inca-pacity to do so.The artists of this country (and the entire continent) cannot take a singlestep without a crutch—be it Marxism or Paris, ancient Indian digs or Toynbee—dandyism as much as anarchism as much as monarchism (I have seen these typesas well). They live on elaborate essays. And because the word inﬂates quickly inthis easy, soft life, all of theisms end in mere verbiage. The word! Their literatureis pretty words. To be an artist it is enough to express oneself beautifully. The mostoriginal and independent writer of Argentina, Borges, writes a ﬁne and elegant1959413Spanish, is a stylist in the literary sense (not in the sense of spiritual solutions), andmost gladly cultivates a literature about literature, a writing about books—and ifsometimes he surrenders himself to pure imagination, it leads him far from life,into a sphere of convoluted metaphysics, the ordering of beautiful rebuses, ascholastics made up of metaphors.The people who are most alert and most pained by this impotence, forexample, the Cuban Piñera, are often too conscious of defeat to be able to ﬁght.Piñera, feeling powerless, pays homage to the Great Absurd, which smashes him—in his art the adoration of the absurd is a protest against a senseless world, hisrevenge, even the blasphemy of a man offended in his morality. ‘‘If meaning, themoral meaning of the world is impossible to attain, I will make a fool of myself’’—this is how Piñera’s revenge and his rebellion look, more or less. But why does he,like so many other Americans, doubt his own strength so much? Well, because forhim it is a matter of the world, not his own life. In the face of the world, humanity,the nation, one is powerless, this exceeds one’s powers—but one can, in spite ofeverything, show them a thing or two with one’s own life, here power returns toman, although in a somewhat limited dimension.Some of them—some of the local writers—are endowed with an efﬁcientbrain mechanism and precision of expression, and cannot move from where theyare only because they have become bogged down in an inherited and obsolete setof problems. This always happens to superﬁcially modern minds. They are con-stantly seeking victory within the rules of the same game when one should beoverturning the chessboard. Coming up with new questions—is the best way oftaking care of the old.Level! Ah, what torment! Level! Ah, how it paralyzes! The main effort isexpended on elevating banality and on complicating truisms, as is always the casewhen one has little to say. This literature, on various social rungs, is always mystiﬁ-cation. Each side wants to write a level higher. The provinces do what they can toequal the capital in artiﬁcial words. The worst thing is when those at the top, fromthe highest rungs of the capital, want to make people know who they are—thentheir inﬂated and twisted sentences become unbearable and one cannot under-stand what they are driving at.An easy life. A provincial life. Here, anyone who has garnered a few prizestransforms himself painlessly into a ‘‘master.’’ But ‘‘maestro’’ means both ‘‘master’’414Volume 2and ‘‘teacher.’’ Because no one wants to write for himself but only for the nation (orreaders), a South American writer is also often a reader, a master of little guys, aleader, enlightener (generally speaking, it is odd how scholastic this culture is . . .so much so that one has the impression that schoolmarms have shaped the nation).With a little good will, the ‘‘maestro’’ succumbs to the next metamorphosis: hebecomes a prophet, seer, sometimes a martyr or hero of America. Strange that in anation so disarmingly modest there is so much pomposity in the upper strata,almost a childish self-aggrandizement.
Saturday
Returning to Polish affairs . . . I prefer to play with my enemies rather thandestroy them. I have always tried to play with my enemies, even when they gave meno peace.Today I am amazed by the delicateness of these hippopotamuses—nowwhen I am on top and can crawl under their skin from time to time for the fun of it.How thin their skin is! Occasionally one of thse dolts, having not yet caught on tothe real, so to speak, relationship of forces, will send a few epithets ﬂying in mydirection out of sheer habit—well, let us assume that I am a poseur, jester, zero, afraud, but if I give him tit for tat, he cries to the high heavens. He is allowed to writethat I am a clown, but I am not allowed to write that he is dull-witted. When hegives me a royal working over from the heights of his bombastic vacuity, everythingis ﬁne. But I am supposed to sit mum! I am not allowed to utter a word because heis a ‘‘critic.’’ And I am not a critic, I am an author, for whom it is ‘‘out of place topolemicize,’’ oh, no, what a lack of tact!When I in my turn take on, just for the fun of it, the criticism of Mr. Critic,without mincing words, a diabolical row breaks out, help, save me, people! ThatGombrowicz is a brute, he is evil, no good, how dare he, that conceited so-and-so,that megalomaniac!Conceited? Megalomaniac? Listen, hippopotamuses: I am not complain-ing that your professional or columnist’s stupidity has constantly slandered mywriting, which, as it turns out, is worth something. You did what you could to ruinmy life and you were partly successful. If it had not been for your dullness, shallow-1959415ness, mediocrity, perhaps I would not have starved for so many years in Argentinaand would have been spared other humiliations. You stood between me and theworld—a group of omnipotent schoolmarms and publicists—warping, twisting,falsifying values and proportions. Fine, never mind all that, I forgive you! And Idon’t expect that one of you will grunt out something on the order of a meek ‘‘I’msorry,’’ I know only too well what I can expect from jokers like you.But how can I forgive your being victorious over me in my ultimate victoryover you? Yes. Cheer up. You have been victorious in defeat. You caused my victoryto come too late . . . ten, twenty years too late . . . as I am too close to death and it in-fects even my triumph with defeat. . . . You know, I am no longer so perverse as tobe happy at the revenge. Triumph? Megalomania—conceit? You have deprivedme even of that—I can delight neither in my exaltation nor in your defeat—howcan I forgive that?
Monday
I like and appreciate Argentina . . . yes, but which Argentina? I do not likeand do not appreciate Argentina . . . yes, but which Argentina?I am a friend of the natural, simple, down-to-earth Argentina of the folk. Iam at war with the higher, ready-made Argentina—that awful concoction!Not long ago one Argentinean said to me: You are allergic to us. Butanother, Jorge Apalos, wrote to me from Santiago: ‘‘You are looking for real value(lo legitimo) in this country because you love it.’’ (Love a country? I?)
Wednesday
Get the government! Everyone is always in opposition and the governmentis always guilty. After the overﬂow of Perón, the idyll took to the streets—joy andvisible emotion, banners and all. But this lasted a whole week. After that, twentyopposition newspapers with gigantic headlines sprang up: government of be-trayal, new tyranny, dignity or death, enough disgrace. After three months,poor General Aramburu, the president, didn’t have even ten percent of the sup-porters (it wasn’t until he left that they pronounced him a decent man).416Volume 2When afterward Frondizi was chosen by an overwhelming majority, againjoy—and then again after a few months he was a: ‘‘traitor,’’ ‘‘renegade,’’ ‘‘tyrant,’’ . . .These were the more delicate compliments. . . .The vociferousness of the opposition press is astounding.The source of these sad phenomena you could probably ﬁnd in the easylife, in the enormous or sparsely populated expanse, where a person can allow him-self a great deal without punishment because ultimately ‘‘things will somehowwork out.’’ If the private life of an American is still characterized by a certain regu-larity and if it is still obvious, for example, that if he does not repair the roof, it willrain on his head, then this social, wider, higher political life becomes somethinglike a Great Frontier—one can clamor, riot, and frolic, for where there is no logic,there is also no responsibility, nothing will happen to so vast a country. And sodemagoguery, claptrap, political lunacy, illusions, theories, phobias, manias, meg-alomanias, caprices, and especially the most ordinary viveza (we can pull thewool over their eyes but they’d better not do it to us!) abound! One can tell peopleabsurdities strewn with the cheapest banalities and life will never unmask them,because collective reality is laxer here—and a blusterer will walk in glory in hisold age.An easy life exudes beneﬁcence, good humor, sentimentality, naïveté,unresourcefulness, delicacy—a softness in which one slowly drowns. But a societythat is threatened by softness, that feels the danger subconsciously, wants to defenditself—this is where that famous viveza comes from, a little bit of cunning that issupposed to prepare them for life, make reality accessible to them anew, save themfrom the shame of gullibility and naïveté.Volumes have been written about the psychology of the South American;they are often metaphysical, almost always too ‘‘deep’’—knowledge about a manor a nation is not always a deep-water ﬁsh—sometimes spiced with a tasty home-grown mysticism (that there is some undiscovered truth in the ‘‘silence’’ of anArgentinean, for example). All right, let it be most profound where it should be,but why should one look for a chasm on the straightaway? Ninety percent ofArgentina and South America can be explained by the life these people lead,a life that is, in spite of their complaints, quite easy in comparison with othercontinents.1959417Saturday
This is how they lose themselves in collective reality, how it becomesfantastic to them, impossible to grasp.In Tandil I speak with the owner of a beautiful villa, the director of a fairlylarge company, a man of experience. I ask him: what do you think, how manypeople were killed during the revolution in Córdoba on 16 September? He thinks amoment, then says: —Twenty-ﬁve thousand.Why, only one battle of this revolution took place in the city of Córdobaand only two regiments of infantry, a school of artillery, and two more militaryformations participated. The battle consisted of ﬁring mainly light weapons and itlasted for two days. The number of fallen was not announced, but if there werethree hundred, that was a lot. . . . And this guy tells me: Twenty-ﬁve thousand!Twenty-ﬁve thousand! What insanity—did he stop to think even for a moment whattwenty-ﬁve thousand corpses means?In Goya (Corrientes) when I said that on 16 June 1955 during the bombingof Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires two hundred people died, they looked at me as if Iwere crazy. In their opinion there were no less than ﬁfteen thousand casualties!Fifteen thousand! I allowed myself to risk the statement that their whole revolutionfrom 1955 did not cost them more than a few hundred lives and most of those as aresult of automobile accidents (because a lot of people ﬂed and others chasedthem). Which offended them greatly.In Santiago a certain law student at the university of Tucumán assured megravely that Freud is useless to South Americans. ‘‘Because Freud is Europeanknowledge, and this is America.’’In Tandil I asked a student from Bahia Blanca, a Communist, if he had everhad a moment of doubt and he answered: —Yes, once. I perked up my earsthinking he would mention the concentration camps, the strangling of Hungary,or the unmasking of Stalin. But he meant Kandinsky, who was ostracized or reallyshunned for abstract painting. This was the only thing he acknowledged as beingout of order . . . a little.Stupidity? No—they are not stupid. It is simply that the world that existsbeyond the concreteness of their family, house, friends, earnings, is dispensable. It418Volume 2offers no resistance. It does not punish for errors, therefore an error does notbecome forbidding. Ultimately, twenty-ﬁve thousand or three hundred is almostthe same. In this kind of conversation, they are sybarites, they prefer the pleasant tothe true.The moment comes, however, when Reality bares its teeth. Thus in Argen-tina—after ten years of prodigality, wage increases, the building up of a completelyincomprehensible bureaucratic apparatus, and printing paper money—the bottomof the purse loomed up and a crisis exploded, the likes of which the country hadnever seen. How difﬁcult it is for them to understand! To this day, the majority areconvinced that the government does not want to guarantee the people afﬂuence.The political crudity of this nation is glaring; they are touched by Daltonism, theydo not know how to distinguish between what is of prime importance in politicsand what is secondary and triﬂing.Yet they are, from birth, magniﬁcent realists. . . .
Monday
A few months after my arrival in Argentina in 1939, a small group of minorliterati, with whom I formed friendships, began to urge me to give a lecture in theTaetro del Pueblo. At the time, I knew nothing of Argentina. I asked what sort oftheater it was. —First class—they answered—these lectures are attended by theelite, the crème de la crème! I decided, therefore, to cook up a lecture that washighly intellectual and, after writing it in French, had it translated into Spanish. Ientitled it: ‘‘Cultural Regression in Lesser Known Europe.’’I intentionally did not mention a word about Poland, since this was a tragictime, immediately after the September events. . . . I described how the wave ofbarbarism that had crashed over Central and Eastern Europe could be used torevise the foundations of our culture.These beginnings of mine in Argentina today look like total darkness,concealing within its womb a tragicomical quiproquo. How did that happen? Ishow up at the theater—overﬂowing with people—I read my paper with a horribleaccent—bravos—and I return quite content to my reserved loge where I ﬁnd anacquaintance, an Argentine girl from the ballet, with a low-cut dress and coinnecklaces. She had come to admire. I am in the process of taking my coat off the1959419hanger to leave with her when I see some guy get onto the stage and declaim—what a spectacle. I understand nothing and hear only ‘‘Polonia.’’ Bravos, excite-ment. After which another guy crawls up to the podium and ﬁres off a speech, allthe while ﬂailing his arms—the public roars. I understand nothing, but I am verypleased that my discourse, which had irritated me like a ﬂy buzzing up my nosewhen I read it, was causing such a stir. Suddenly—what’s this?—our envoy rises andtogether with other members of the Polish Legation leaves the hall. Oh, oh,something is not right! . . . More speeches, the atmosphere heats up, more clamor,someone turns to me: —Why don’t you do something? They’re attacking Po-land! . . . A ﬁne pickle! How am I supposed to react to a sermon in Chinese?The next day—trouble. As it turned out, my lecture was used by the Com-munists to attack Poland. It also turned out that the somewhat communizing‘‘intellectual elite’’ was not all that creamy, the result being that the attack on‘‘fascist Poland’’ did not distinguish itself with reﬁnement and stupid things weresaid, such as there is no Polish literature and that the only Polish writer is BrunoJasie ´ nski.* Appalled, I ran to the Legation—where I was received icily, and sus-pected of sabotage, almost of treason. In vain did I explain that the theater director,Mr. Barletta, had neglected to inform me that, according to custom, there is adiscussion after the lecture (I have no reason to suspect him of deliberately keepingme in the dark; besides, I did not consider him a Communist, as he passed himselffor—and to this day passes himself for—an upright, enlightened, and progressivecitizen, impartial and just, an opponent of imperialists and a friend of the people; itwas only during the Hungarian revolution, when the impartial, just, and nobleanti-imperialism of Mr. Barletta inclined him categorically to support Russiantanks, that I lost all vestiges of my faith).The worst was the ballerina—her rough, powder, neckline, and coins com-pleted the balance of my misfortune.—What cynicism—they said.—At such a mo-ment! As far as I remember, even the Polish press in the United States jumped onthe bandwagon . . . but I would have been capable of withstanding this tornadoof mad suspicions, accusations, and condemnations, if not for Pyzik! Pyzik, the
*Bruno Jasie ´ nski (1901–37), Polish futurist poet who switched to writing revolutionarypoetry and novels. Arrested in the Soviet Union in 1937, he died on his way to a concentration campin Kolyma. He was rehabilitated in 1957.420Volume 2president of the Union of Poles in Argentina, wrote something in his article thatknocked me out . . . to wit, he accused me of not mentioning a word about thePolish school system. . . . What???? The school system???? What school system?Why the school system? Ha! That’s all I needed—the Polish school system!

Monday
I devoured a few pages with great satisfaction, that he is so intelligent and,bravo, that he reads me so thoroughly, that he is familiar with even the little nooksand crannies of my writings, ah, the critic who reads, what a rarity! (I am talkingabout ‘‘Key Issues in Gombrowicz’s The Marriage,’’ written by Andrzej Falkiewiczand published in Poland.) But the farther one goes into this forest, however, thethicker the underbrush—and by the time I got to the end of Falkiewicz’s essay, Ihad lost my way . . . I, the subject, I, who should know this territory. . . . So what canI expect of others?This is disturbing . . . especially since I cannot dismiss it as the clumsinessof the critic, who is penetrating, earnest, unusually subtle. . . . Why the misunder-standing? And if it had been only one of many! But this has happened to me somany times with other critics—that I think it proves not so much the inadequacy ofthe critics as the perversion of criticism itself, in particular of the most difﬁcultkind, concerning literature that comes into being today, that is, the literature oftomorrow, ‘‘modern’’ literature. I even feel that the situation is perilous, that some-thing must be changed in the method, in the attitude, or in something else. I don’tknow—something innovative is absolutely essential, like having the authors andcritics work together . . . perhaps this would work to pull the wagon out of the mire?As things are now, the author, though he is alive, has to pretend he is dead.I was once present at a ﬁerce discussion between Kott—and Breiter?—on what X‘‘wanted to say’’ in his last work. They pelted each other with quotes. I proposedthat they put the question to the author over the telephone and even gave them hisnumber. They stopped dead in their tracks and in a minute began to talk aboutsomething else. When the problem was reduced to a question over the telephone,it ceased to interest them.1959421To get back to Falkiewicz—if even he, in my opinion, did not understandThe Marriage completely, where should I look for the source of the problem? Isn’tit because in his impatience he wanted to understand it too profoundly right away?One should advise critics of the modern and most difﬁcult art not to be so pro-found right off the bat—they should be shallow at the beginning, and then gradu-ally and very carefully should immerse themselves in searching for profundities.My point is this: each literary work exists on various planes, some closer and othersmore distant, but ﬁrst the story must ‘‘move, amuse, make you laugh,’’ then itacquires various ‘‘more profound meanings,’’ and only in its ultimate sense be-comes (if it does at all) precipitous, vertiginous, and sometimes crazy. One has toestablish this rule and adhere to it: one can speak about the deeper aspects ofmodern art only after mastering the more immediate, easier aspects which join it tothe art that preceded it.Falkiewicz began to look behind the curtain prematurely, he neglected tolook ﬁrst at what was happening onstage. He is wrong to say that The Marriage is‘‘unclear and inconsistent’’—on the contrary. What is so strange about a dream (anoutlet for daytime worries) that shows Henry the ruin and disgrace of his parents,his ﬁancée, the family home? Is it so strange that in this dream about an innDrunkards appear and that these Drunkards begin to persecute the Father whenhe forbids them to touch Molly? Is it not logical and appropriate to the situationthat the panic-stricken Father pronounces himself ‘‘an Untouchable King’’ toelude the touch of the Drunkard? And that Henry feels in his dream that he aloneis responsible for sustaining the miracle or having it totter into farce—is this not afeeling that often visits us in our dreams? So isn’t his waivering between Wisdomand Stupidity at the beginning of act 2 understandable? And his new grapplingwith the Drunkard, who intrudes once again with his Finger to ‘‘touch’’ the kingand then Molly? But the Drunkard, seeing that he is unable to overcome Henry inopen battle, changes his tactics, proposes to ‘‘have a little talk’’ on the side—theresult of which is that the scene transforms itself into a courtly, diplomatic recep-tion (has such a change of scenery never occurred to you in a dream?). And,further on, isn’t it the culmination of a psychological process already begun inthe opening act when Henry’s growing doubts about the royalty of the king lead,in a more and more muddled atmosphere of drunkenness, to a coup d’état?When, by reverting to new methods, the Drunkard arouses jealousy in the new422Volume 2king about Johnny—is he not consistent in his striving to obstruct the marriage and‘‘get at’’ Molly?The marriage that Henry would like to perform on himself in the third actis, as Falkiewicz correctly writes, a consequence of his idea that God did not createman but man created God. This marriage in the ‘‘human church,’’ replacing theformer in the ‘‘divine church,’’ is the main metaphor of the drama. When there isno God, values are born of, or rather between, people. But our hero’s dominionover the people must become real—that is why Henry needs Johnny’s death, that iswhy he commands the release of his parents and the Drunkard to pit himselfagainst them in one ﬁnal clash. And here he collapses. . . .Is this action so difﬁcult to extract from the text? Certainly, I myself am notwithout blame. In the introduction (‘‘Idea of the Play’’), I wrote: ‘‘Everything in theplay ‘creates itself’: Henry creates a dream and a dream creates Henry, the action ofthe play creates itself, people create one another, and the whole pushes forwardtoward unknown solutions.’’*How careful one must be! I know now that this imprecise formulation canlead one astray. In writing about creating oneself, and especially in saying thataction creates itself, I had in mind that one scene often arises from another in acasual way, almost accidentally, and that the drama, as an embodiment of theinner spiritual work of Henry, makes up a canvas of associations that is sometimesabsurd and that sometimes eludes form—but I forgot to add that these superﬁcialfreedoms are based on the core of the story, which the drama tells, and which in itsgeneral outline is not deprived of logic. I did not mention this because it seemed soobvious to me at ﬁrst.Falkiewicz grasped this outline, but he didn’t follow it to the end. Ledastray by my murky information about ‘‘creating oneself,’’ he conceives of thedrama as an almost completely unrestrained explosion of associations and, as aconsequence, seeks justiﬁcation in the breakneck antics of the latest trends inphilosophy, sociology, and psychology even for things which can be explained bythe normal course of action. He ponders the existential and antiexistential sense ofmy laughter, seeks the ultimate contradiction between the problems and the form,
*The Marriage, trans. Louis Iribarne (New York: Grove Press, 1969; Evanston, Ill.: North-western University Press, 1986), 16.1959423analyzes my ties to ‘‘dream logic,’’ but sometimes does not notice the most obviouslinks in the development of the plot. From which comes the moral of avant-gardecriticism: beware! Only gradually and with the greatest caution do you descend tothe most profound layers of a work—never lose the connections between surfaceand depths. Grasp the work ﬁrst in its easiest, its most public form, and then gobackstage. Metaphysics, yes, but one must begin with physics. Grasp the work, too,in its connection with the past, with a more classical literature, because ultimatelyeven the most revolutionary outgrowth stems from previous forms the reader isfamiliar with. And accept the principle that if something ﬁnds its justiﬁcation inthe physics of a work, very often it can do without metaphysics. I have oftenexperienced on my own hide that heaven and earth have been moved to explain acomma which simply resulted from the construction of a sentence. . . .

A few more words about avant-garde criticism, but now in its more jour-nalistic aspect and without ties to Falkiewicz. . . . One must simplify. One mustfacilitate, simplify things for the reader! You have turned too far away from him,your reviews swell with indigestibles. This is exactly one of those problems of style,one of those real problems of style—which are a headache and silliness itself, andwhich one haughtily avoids because they are too practical by nature, not enough àla hauteur. . . . I, if I cultivated this profession of an avant-garde critic, would standon my head to change and improve something here, to break out of this deadlock.Who is this avant-garde critic who writes in a newspaper? Is he an intellec-tual? An artist? A teacher? A journalist? If he is a journalist, one must admit that heis not enough of a journalist, he does not know how to reach the reader. If he is ateacher, this is knowledge that is far too ranting, condensed, hurried, unclear. If heis an artist, he is not charming enough, he is too heavy, he does not know how todance. . . . In the role of an intellectual he is reminiscent of goulash, stew, salad,tripe in oil, cabbage and peas. And how often he turns out to be an élégant with soiled underwear and dirty ﬁngernails because all this tends to be poorly laun-dered, not thought through, and poorly written . . . pretentious shoddiness, terror(of both readers and editors). Snobbery? Why, of course, snobbery. Unfortunately,this is true, this discipline is polluted with snobbery and claptrap. Take a look at the424Volume 2sentences which crush the reader with their dernier cri terminology while theirconstruction, punctuation, and grammar are lousy. A magniﬁcent tie worn with asoiled shirt.The question is, what can one correct here, where should one begin? Inmy opinion, reform is needed, and it is high time for it. If criticism, especiallyavant-garde criticism, has become ﬁctional, pompous, deceptive, it is because it issuspended in abstractions, far from any kind of concrete ﬂesh, blood, and bone—these critics wallow in art, culture, philosophy, and other such generalities—well,one can easily drown reality in this and really have a good time! The essence of theproblem, then, is breaking with abstraction and linking up to that lost concretedetail. When the critic feels that he is a man writing about another man and forpeople, when he ﬁnds his lost Sociability, he will gain a solid basis for manypressing revisions.The pseudoscience of today’s criticism is becoming unbearable. The schoolsare to blame for this—high schools and universities—the universities have done alot of damage by convincing people that one can approach art scientiﬁcally. Howcatastrophic this method of occupying oneself exclusively with the work, torn awayfrom the person of the author, turned out to be!—after this abstraction cameothers, which separated the work from the author even more, conceiving of it as aself-sufﬁcient ‘‘object,’’ conceiving of it ‘‘objectively,’’ transferring everything to therealm of a false, lame aesthetic or sociological pseudo-mathematics, opening thegates wide to pedantry and prating analyses as well as to license, dressed super-ﬁcially in majestic scientiﬁc precision. I do not at all demand that a work beinterpreted naively through the biography of the writer and that his art be tied tohis life’s experiences—my point is the principle contained in the aphorism ‘‘style isthe man,’’ that is, that Chopin’s style is the organization of Chopin’s soul, andRabelais’s style is the solution to Rabelais’s personality. Chopin’s romances withGeorges Sand interest me little—but beyond Chopin’s music I look for Chopinhimself; I want to understand the creator by way of his work. Behind the tale Poetells me I must ﬁnd the person who tells it, as—understand this—the only reality,the only thing that is concrete. Thus I draw conclusions about the creator from hiswork; yet once again this personality of the creator will simplify and open up a workby binding it inseparably to someone . . . to someone’s particular existence.What is this or any other work? ‘‘A work of art,’’ ‘‘a cultural phenomenon,’’1959425‘‘an expression of social processes,’’ ‘‘a source of aesthetic feelings’’—or perhaps it isﬁrst of all a person’s work, an element of someone’s life, someone’s spiritual effort.Who doubts that Hamlet is not just Shakespeare’s reverie but also Hamlet, that is,an imagined character, but as authentic as if he were more alive than Shake-speare . . . in addition, Hamlet contains discoveries and beauty that ensure him anexistence independent of Shakespeare’s. Yet in spite of all that, the truth aboutHamlet is that Shakespeare made him up (even though Shakespeare was evenmore elusive than Hamlet) and it is only this Danish prince, bound to his creator,ﬁxed in his creator, who is one hundred percent real. Do you remember Des-cartes? When I think of the centaur, I cannot be certain that a centaur existed—theonly thing I know for sure is that my thought about a centaur exists. . . . AlthoughHamlet, the Danish prince, is imagined, the Shakespearean dream of Hamletexisted and this is the concrete fact that we desperately need. When you begin tocarry on about ‘‘art,’’ you can say whatever you like—abstractions offer no re-sistance. When you discover the persons behind the books, however, when yourliterary world becomes peopled with Tolstoys, Schillers, Balzacs, Ibsens, whenstyle becomes someone’s personal style, when you link form to someone’s experi-ence, then much of the fog now blanketing our eyes will burn away. No, I do notforget that form and art are born ‘‘between’’ people and not of man; I am very farfrom granting the creator exclusivity, but if modern criticism is to regain strength,sociability, efﬁcacy within the pale of the human world, we must look beyond thework to the man, to the creator, at least as a point of reference. Not—for heaven’ssake—in order to ask ‘‘What was he trying to say?’’ (this would again reducecriticism to the examination of the intellectual, that is, abstract, intentions of theauthor and, anyway, this kind of questioning is irrelevant in art). But in orderfor a book to grow out of some sort of—out of someone’s—reality, out of some-one’s experience.While establishing this kind of contact with the person of the author,should not the critic also introduce his own person onto the stage? Analyses, sure,syntheses, yes, dissections and parallels, well, so be it, but at least let this be organic,red-blooded, pulsating, permeated with the critic, let it be him, his spoken voice.Critics! Write so that the person reading you knows whether you have blond orblack hair.(I dedicate this to Poland. Before the war, while listening to their conver-426Volume 2sations—when Knowledge, Society, and everything that was social and rationalwas worshipped, when people turned with fury against the Person and the Per-sonal, when they hated, worse, did not like art for its intimate uncontrollablewhisper—while listening to them, to these artist-moralizers, artist-constructors,artist-theoreticians, and poet-mathematicians—I knew already that an incompe-tent epoch in art was approaching, an epoch full of painful mistakes.)
Thursday
I ate breakfast at the harbor. A series of scenes expressing one and the sameidea. At a neighboring table workers discussed politics; one smarted off, gabbed,palavered, others also smarted off, palavered—at the same time, far inside, theresigned owner tried to convince the waiter of something; the waiter, an old and slyman, but a dolt and a loudmouth, threw himself at the owner excitedly, drunk withhis own inanities, deafening himself with his own twaddle. Farther still portersjoked, chortling on the subject of a certain part of the body. . . . What idea did thisexpress? An awful one! Probably the one that is most capable of depriving people ofhope. . . .We, the intelligentsia, are guided by the salutary thought that the lowerclasses are not crazy. . . . We, yes, we are condemned to all the illnesses, manias,madnesses, but the masses are healthy . . . and the foundation on which humanityleans is just ﬁne. . . . And actually? The people are sicker, crazier than we are!Peasants are madmen! Workers—pathological! Do you hear what they are saying?These are dark and maniacal dialogues. Illiterates dull not with a healthy dullnessbut with the ravings of a madman, crying for a hospital, a doctor. . . . Can theirnever-ending curses and obscenities—and nothing beyond that—can this drunken,mad mechanics of their life together be healthy? Shakespeare was right to presentthe simple folk as ‘‘exotic,’’ that is, unlike human beings.
Monday
To the editor of Wiadomo´sci:It is only now that I have had the opportunity to acquaint myself withthe fragment of Lecho ´n’s Diary reprinted in the sixteenth issue of Wiadomo´ sci, of 19 April of this year, in which he mentions me and my Trans-Atlantic.1959427‘‘Gombrowicz . . . is also a madman, I am sure because I know him. . . . Trans-Atlantic is a very seedy story. . . . Amusing enough though somewhat foul-smelling. . . .’’Such being the case, I will allow myself to quote the following excerptfrom Lecho ´ n’s letter to me, received in May 1956, that is, a month before hisdeath:‘‘I will reply in your words ‘your soul is somehow familiar to me’ and I would likeit to give me credit once and for all. If a work of art appeals to me, this outweighsall differences of conviction and even grudges between writers. I think of yourworks, Ferdydurke and Trans-Atlantic, with considerable pleasure, as stunningworks. . . .’’And he continues:‘‘I would like you to know, therefore, that I expressed what I think of you mostsincerely and, I think, with all due respect, in an interview published a fewyears ago in Wiadomo´sci and that this is for now my modest Roma locuta.’’???????(1) Keeping in mind that the above-mentioned fragment of Lecho ´ n’s Diary comes from the year 1953, and the letter from 1956, perhaps one couldassume that Lecho ´ n changed his mind. . . .(2) Rejecting this explanation, we would have to assume that thesepassages in the letter are hypocrisy from beginning to end. But to what purpose?This assumption would be painful, since I value Lecho ´ n.
I include the text of Lecho ´ n’s letter because, of course, it didn’t get printedwithout being invaded by the meddlesome pencil of the editor of Wiadomo´ sci. Namely, the beginning was changed as follows:
‘‘In his ‘Pages from a Diary’ dated 1 March 1953 ( Wiadomo´ sci, No. 681), Jan Lecho ´n writes in connection with my Trans-Atlantic: ‘Gombrowicz . . . is also amadman . . . ,’ ’’ etc.
Holy Mother of God! I can’t hold this against them—they sent me thecorrected text and I, for the sake of peace and quiet, did not protest—but isn’t it justa tiny bit irritating that not even a few lines of a letter written to the editor can beincluded without corrections and alterations? And isn’t this rummaging through428Volume 2letters, not articles, altogether indelicate and rude, especially with respect to thosewho have covered reams of paper with writing? If only this correction had beenmade in the name of Holy Grammar! All because I wrote ‘‘it is only now that I havehad the opportunity to become acquainted with,’’ from which the broad masses ofreaders could deduce that I rarely peek into that newspaper. Oh well, it is true, Irarely do, but that Altissimo besmirched me. I found out only a few months laterand by accident (at the Swieczewskis’, while putting on my coat). Of course thefact that the shot ﬁred at me from London reached me so late hardly testiﬁes to thedevastating properties of the old culverin, but are the only letters that have achance of being printed in Wiadomo´ sci without corrections those exclaiming ‘‘Ijust can’t wait to get the next issue, etc., etc.,’’? Maybe the letters of praise are alsotampered with?That this was a bullet and a shot that they were aiming at me with theintention of shooting me dead or at least wounding me—I am positive. The shotcame after my delightful scrap with a certain Polonist ﬁguring in World Biography(New York, 1948). But one must admit they have bad luck. For the heroic attack onthe author of the novel The Quiet of the Forest allowed me to praise myself until Iburst, as I have never praised myself in my life—and now it ends so badly thatAltissimo’s devastating opinion has transformed itself with the help of a little blackmagic into the same Altissimo’s almost archlaudatory and positive opinion. And Iput all the faithful who belong to this little chapel face-to-face with an awfuldilemma—for either-or: either Altissimo Poet is enraptured with that seedy Trans-Atlantic, or Altissimo Poet is a regular bluffer and a ﬁrst-class pharisee. Enough.Jokes aside. What sort of magic was this? How could Lecho ´ n make such a leapfrom abomination to rapture in so brief a time (the interview that he mentions inhis letter bears the date 1954, and even then he is speaking of me rather favorably)?There is a riddle concealed here, one that is interesting to a student of literary life.Perhaps the riddle is confusing only because—like that document fromPoe’s short story—the solution is staring us in the face instead of hiding in the secretdrawer. Why the change of opinion? Because he never had one. Why didn’t hehave one? Because he never read it. I sometimes wondered how it happened thatstudents were perfectly capable of handling the contents of my works while profes-sional literati said the same stupid things over and over again. A student reads,that’s all—a literatus looks at, ﬂips through, sniffs out. . . . I sense that Lecho ´ n read1959429me as much as I read his poems . . . but wasn’t this the reason our opinions did notdig a chasm between us? . . . After all, his notes were private, he hadn’t intendedthem to be published. Sometimes it’s worse. A few years ago, a certain well-knownpublicist gave me a dressing down in the Polish press on how my Diary was terriblyprovincial . . . that these were merely ‘‘endless variations on the subject: Poland andI. . . .’’ I rubber my eyes (Had this man written that in a drunken stupor? I don’tthink ten percent of the diary is about Polish matters), until I ﬁgured out that hehad read just the few fragments in Kultura, which happened to be about Poland,and that from this gnawed bone he had imagined the entire animal.A few more words about Lecho ´ n. He was an uncreative and unoriginal poetwho was too highly esteemed at the beginning—who for his whole life remainednothing but a ‘‘promise.’’ An uncomfortable situation that aggravated his innatecreative impotence. What was worse, this poet, barricaded in a tower of classicism(the consequence of an excessive pomposity as well as of barrenness; classicism isthe ‘‘expertise’’ of artists having nothing to say), completely lost a sense of modernman and his problems (about which, nota bene, he knew little, since the paths ofhuman thought beginning with Hegel were almost completely unknown to thisPolish head). His life was disloyal, his place in the hierarchy undeserved, hisposition insincere; none of these things allowed him direct contact with the epoch,with history. He sneaked by. He eluded it and maintained face. At one point hefound himself out of it. His whole politics consisted of releasing a ‘‘beautiful’’ poeminto the world now and then (so that people would not say, too loudly, that he wasﬁnished), as well as of nurturing his social prestige, in which his background,intelligence, and wit were very helpful to him. He also wrote for his ‘‘drawer’’ a diarywhich was excellent writing and luminous with a natural intelligence, but compro-mising because of a pathological, almost complexlike, narrowing of intellectualhorizons—as if this man preferred not to know, preferred not to see—a melancholydiary, a pitiful incarnation of the Warsaw bourgeois spirit and the cafés of thatday. . . . This was how Lecho ´ n tried to pretend that he lived, by reviving a deadworld from his youth, from times that had treated him more graciously. . . . Stop!What is this, did I hate Lecho ´ n? Why am I destroying him? Destroying? No! Not atall! Wouldn’t dream of it! I value Lecho ´ n! The more reasons I ﬁnd to denigratehim, the more I value him; I value him in spite of the reasons I have given, I valuehim because in spite of everything, this was someone —this was a personage—no one430Volume 2knows how, no one knows why this proﬁle has become engraved in our memories;the gestures, tone, silhouette, will remain long after everyone has forgotten hiswork. . . .He realized himself as a person. Even though this man made no signiﬁ-cant contribution to Polish progress with even one important poem, one thought,nevertheless he created something . . . he created himself . . . he created JanLecho ´n. And perhaps it is this game with his own nothingness that fascinates me,this realizing himself in a vacuum, that not having even one-tenth of the poeticmerits of Tuwim, he was able to distinguish himself in our literary world withalmost the same intensity. . . . At any rate, this was a ﬁgure to contend with!A ﬁgure, nevertheless, that does not lend itself to what Wiadomo´ sci doeswith it, Lecho ´ n as the bard of the emigration—what a bad idea; he was predestinedfor that chair only by his worst weaknesses, his veneration of the past, his classicallyPolish romanticism, and everything in him that unfortunately came straight out ofKurier Warszawski. It was too obvious that the publicity in Wiadomo´ sci was dictatedmore by the megalomania of the editors than by the recognition of Lecho ´ n’s alleged greatness—this campaign was inspired by the conviction that the ‘‘readers’’can be talked into anything—the odor of this conviction mingled fatally withincense and mingles still today. Beyond the Wiadomo´ sci coterie, no one took upthis thesis; Lecho ´ n had miserable press coverage in Poland after his death, even inthe camp favorably inclined toward him—the bard remained the local Londonbard. And it is sad that the man who was a ‘‘splendid Lecho ´ n’’ was made (throughunbearable cant) into a ‘‘splendid poet’’—poor guy, he came out of this campaignon the short end of the stick.

One more little word about Wiadomo´ sci. Actually, I myself am amazed andappalled, but this time I must admit that Mr. Zbyszewski is right: this publicationwas exciting, compelling, and illuminating at one time and Grydzewski was doingPoland a great service. But now?
For you must know, my dearest crone,That paradise has become a crickWhere Jove once ruled from his throneThere now rules a pri . . .1959431Add a rhyme yourself, my gracious prince! How did this betrayal of Gry-dzewski by Grydzewski come about? One has to begin talking about this and notfor the sake of petty annoyance: today Wiadomo´ sci is a chapel, museum, mutualadoration society, catalog, album of withered souvenirs, cemetery, armorial, cornerfor philatelists or billiard players, anecdote, chat, correction, snobbery, little col-umn—but most of all it is the resurrected and, as it turns out, immortal KurierWarszawski. Unfortunately! There is really something that bodes ill in this victoryof the Lewenthal family from beyond the grave—who would have dreamed it! ThisLondon weekly is the most recent edition of the same indestructible bourgeoisiefrom Krakowskie Przedmie´scie.* And this really is a National Institution wholehog: here the proofreader has triumphed over the writer; the reader over theauthor; the editor over the writer; the comma and semicolon over talent; form,trademark, pattern over individuality; formalism over art; organization and bu-reaucracy over ﬂights of fancy, drama, poetry, and life. During the past dozen yearsof its life, Wiadomo´ sci has managed to alienate practically all the creative elementsof literature in emigration. Mi™osz was treated with a boisterous unintelligenceworthy of the late Rabski;† a bucket of table scraps was poured over Mi™osz’s headand he was pronounced a ‘‘traitor’’—which did not prevent him from affecting theorientation of world opinion toward red terror in Poland more effectively than allthe issues of Wiadomo´ sci put together. Who of today’s better authors contributes tothis publication? Not only has it been cut off from talent, it has been cut off fromliving Polish thought. If there is any kind of discussion, effort, struggle, anything atall going on in emigration, it takes place a hundred miles from Wiadomo´ sci and itscontests: ‘‘Whom should we nominate to the Literary Academy?’’ I, rightly orwrongly, successfully or not, have touched on a multitude of issues of primeimportance for us in the course of my writing in emigration—I received not oneserious commentary or decent polemic in Wiadomo´ sci in the space of ten years,nothing except cursory ‘‘reviews’’ which were not as bad as they were shallow,twittering, unwisely nonchalant, and often malicious. Naturally, one should notforget that garbage must be our daily fare in emigration and when it is a matter ofcritics, beggars can’t be choosers—yet if Mr. Grydzewski were able to tolerate
*Old boulevard in Warsaw.†W™adys™aw Rabski, second-rate writer at Kurier Warszawski.432Volume 2modern Polish thought and Polish writing, if he were not allergic to them,Wiadomo´ sci’s relations with writers could have worked out more pleasantly and thecontributors to the publication would have gradually gotten better. The way it isnow is pitiful, it really is! In Poland no one is interested in Wiadomo´ sci, thepublication has no political signiﬁcance at all on a broader scale, it has nothing,absolutely nothing at all in common with the current artistic strivings of the nationor emigration. The only thing that has remained are the readers, still convincedthat they are terribly high-minded to be subscribing to this Olympian organ andparticipating in the contests and polls that are embarrassing testimony to nothingbut complete disorientation, an artistic jumble and intellectual hodgepodge, andglaring proof that in the heads of Mr. Grydzewski’s sheep absolutely nothing hasstirred since 1939.(. . .

Saturday
At around nine o’clock the insistent ringing of the doorbell awakened me—at the door was a short little someone in a big hat—and quietly, almost inaudibly, Icould hear him asking for the real estate agent Delgado.—No, he doesn’t livehere!—I slammed the door. The end. Period. Dot.And then I could not get back to sleep, so I put on a record with Beetho-ven’s Fourteenth Quartet. Bach? No, not Bach. . . . Actually, I don’t like Bach . . .they, modern music, will one day notice through their glasses that Bach was notthe right signpost and that he led them to bankruptcy. You adore him because allyou can afford is mathematics, the cosmos and purity—oh, that astronomic, paleface of yours nags and torments! You gain the heavens but you lose the earth, youeunuchs! In love with Abstraction, you have forgotten that song served to enchantthe female, and nothing will be able to get you out of the Music as such, to whichyou have devoted yourselves for lack of anything better. The end. Period. As forBeethoven, I have had enough of his symphonies, his orchestra is incapable ofdrawing me in for good and holding me at bay—but the quartets of his last period,where the sound is difﬁcult, on the borderline and even beyond it. . . . Oh, youFourteenth Quartet!If I listen to you so moved, it is probably because you are abundant insensual delight as much in form as in the violence perpetrated on this form in thename of . . . I wanted to say in the name of the Spirit, but I will say in the name ofthe creator. For, O crowning glory of the quartets, every moment your four instru-ments sound in their union, reach for the most intoxicating harmonies, and windaround in voluptuous modulations; and yet, now and again, a severe and even434Volume 2brutal hand violates that delight and forces you to terrifying sharpness, suddenjumps, a hard economy of expression straining for metaphysics, an ascetic expres-sion stretched between the highest and lowest registers, listening with rapt atten-tion to a more distant and higher realization. Suddenly, it got quiet. The recordended. Period and point.I have to go have coffee.10:00 (In the Café Querandi)I was drinking coffee, I was eating crescent rolls. And something else.When the waiter walked up to ask what I needed, his hand hung down, quiet,curled up, secret—and idle—until not knowing what to think, I thought aboutsome sort of bush, which I had looked at once at a station, from the window of mytrain. The hand attacked me in the silence that fell between us. . . . Period. Theend. Someone was already walking in and sitting down noisily at a neighboringtable—two men—and they asked for dice.I pulled letters out of my pocket.‘‘This is a strange example of great intelligence whose object of interest is aﬁeld from which he is intuitively cut off. . . . ’’‘‘Sandauer est arrivé ici il y a une dizaine de jours. . . . ’’‘‘Passing through Kielce, I found Rena. . . . ’’‘‘Richter sent me copies of his letters in which he explains all the odditiesand problems of this prose. . . . ’’10:45 (At Home)The hand of the waiter had vanished and was no more. Until a certainthought from Nietzsche injected it with a dose of splendid existence.Neske, the German publisher of Heidegger, sent me his Essais et con-férences, published by Gallimard. The book lay next to the record with the quartetand caught my attention. Why, here in his lecture on Zarathustra, Heideggerdiscusses the thought that Nietzsche called his ‘‘most abysmal’’—about the eternalreturn, ‘‘which liberates the spirit of vengeance,’’ vanquishes time that escapes,time that approaches, and imparts to becoming the character of being. Imprimerau devenir le caractère de l’être . . . telle est la plus haute volonté de puissance.I won’t let them lead me around by the nose—I am familiar with this1960435childhood, frolicking with Inﬁnity, I know all too well how much frivolity andirresponsibility is needed to proudly enter the terraces of those thoughts-not-to-be-thought and severity-not-to-be-withstood, I know this brilliance! And this Heideg-ger, at his Nietzschean lecture, suspended over the precipices—clowns! To despisethe abyss and not to digest unreasonable thoughts—I determined to do this longago. I ridicule a metaphysics . . . . . . which devours me (nota bene?).It is interesting that at the same time and without the least embarrassment Ican be a man and a Man. While wondering whether or not to send out the laundry,I am like an arc stretching from there, from the primal beginning, to its latestrealizations in what is before me. Not losing a most everyday train of thought foreven a second, I am the Mystery of being and its pride, its malady and torment. Thebitterness of humanity. The fury of humanity. The unleashing of humanity. Thequiet of humanity. The quiet hand of the waiter there in Querandi—quiet andcurled up. What is it doing there—while I am here?11:30If I had not returned to the hand of the waiter, it would have easily disinte-grated into nothingness. . . . And now it will keep returning to me because I havereturned to it.12:00 (At the Ambassador’s)One of those limpid days with a refreshing heat, deliciously mixing latespring with early summer. The park has become green from the palace to the river,which, as almost always, is immobile and blinding. Breakfast was served in thepavilion, outdoors. Sausage patties—then small and masterly beefsteaks on toast,probably à la Chateaubriand, with artichokes—and phenomenal desserts of coldfruit and cream—add to this a few wines, ﬁve butlers.Adante scherzo quasi allegretto. Sun ﬂashing on crowns of fern. Conversa-tion ripples and gleams. And the minister plenipotentiary, an amphitryon, play-fully wraps the serpent of conversation ﬁrst around Spanish bulls, then aroundAztec sculpture, Parisian theater, Argentine asado. The topiary swans glisten withpearls, while we—the guests, butlers—are like a concert hushed in ﬂawless singing.The French ambassador ﬁnds a few kind words for the writer who has paid him a436Volume 2visit, and the ﬂash of a restrained smile appears on the lips of both ambassadors(that is, his and mine). Liqueurs are served.A diplomatic hand on the arm of the chair, with ﬁngers slightly bent, but itis not this hand but that one, left there as a point of reference —a distant ﬂash in the night, a beacon! Farewell, land! I am on the open sea, foam spurting, wind, storm,furrowed waters . . . and the open sea, open thunder and fury.(Satisfaction that I had not donned my white but cream-colored shirt fromSmart—because we ate in the garden—and that I did not have on too ornate a tie,brown, single-toned, rather unattractive.)5:00 (In the Car of the Embassy Attaché Ofﬁcer)She swallowed the hook. . . .

I read this in the paper.I was alone, I was sitting on the couch with the paper and before me in themiddle of the room were two tables loaded with papers, the back of the chair, a1960437typewriter cover, farther away a wardrobe. I was on the open, open, open sea. Whatcan one do? Pity? I will have pity here—and they there. . . . Love? I will love here— and they there. . . . If only our positions didn’t bypass each other. . . . A strong wind,dark masses of water that are thrown up and fall back in an uncontained boiling,drowning in one another, a furrowed expanse, an expanse of unappeased move-ment, no land, no lighthouse and only there, there, there, in Querandi, that one,that chosen land . . . what is its purpose?I am very afraid of the devil. A strange confession from the lips of anunbeliever. I am incapable of liberating myself from the idea of the devil. . . . Thisroaming of the dreadful in my immediate vicinity . . . What good are the police,rights, all guarantees and means of solicitude if a Monster strolls freely among usand nothing protects us from him, nothing, nothing, there is no barrier betweenhim and us.

Absolutely nothing, only empty space. . . . The earth upon which wewalk is so covered with pain, we wade in it up to our knees—and this is today’s,yesterday’s, the day before yesterday’s pain, the pain from a thousand years ago—forone should not be deluded, pain does not dissolve in time and the cry of a childfrom thirty centuries ago is no less of a cry than the one that resounded three daysago. This is the pain of all generations and all beings—not just of man. And ﬁnally. . . but who told you that death can bring some sort of peace by releasing you fromthis world? ‘‘And what if nothing but spiders are ‘there’?’’ And what if there is painthere inﬁnitely exceeding anything we can imagine? You don’t tremble too muchat the thought of that moment because you surrender to the illusive certainty thatbeyond that wall you will encounter nothing that will be completely ahuman—where does this certainty come from? What authorizes you to have it? Isn’t theresome diabolical principle contained even in the very womb of our world which isinaccessible to man, inconceivable to the human mind and emotion? Where isour guarantee that the other world is supposed to be more human? Perhaps it isantihumanity itself, the complete contradiction of our nature? But we cannotaccept this, for man because of his nature—and this is certain—is incapable ofcomprehending evil.Point. I want to believe that in Querandi there is nothing deviating fromthe most ordinary of the ordinary even though I lack all basis for such an assump-438Volume 2tion . . . but the presence of evil makes my existence something so risky . . . sodisturbing . . . so inclined to the diabolical . . . that in truth it would be difﬁcult forme to succumb to any certainty at all, especially since the lack of data in this casehas exactly the same meaning as an abundance of data.6:30That ridiculous Leon Bloy! One day he writes in his journal that thatmorning a terrible cry awakened him, as if it were coming from inﬁnity. He did notdoubt that this was the cry of a damned soul, so he fell to his knees and surrenderedhimself to ardent prayer.The next day he writes: ‘‘Ah, now, I know whose soul that was. The pressannounced that Alfred Jarry died yesterday, at exactly the same hour and minute atwhich I heard his cry. . . . ’’And now for a contrast—the ridiculous Alfred Jarry! In order to avengehimself on God, he asked for a toothpick and picking his teeth, died.I prefer him to Bloy, whom God supplied mainly with a splendid ‘‘abso-lute’’ superiority over other mortals. Bloy lived well off the Omnipotent One.Medieval mind, medieval soul? During the time of Charlemagne the roleof the intelligentsia was exactly the opposite of today. Then an intellectual wassubmitted to the collective thought (of the church) and it was the simple man whothought—empirically, dogmatically—for himself—in practical, daily matters. . . .Today it is just the opposite. . . . Nothing will stop the intelligentsia from runningriot any longer . . . (the way communism would like). . . . I have to go see J.If I could for one moment cope with the whole. To constantly live onlywith fragments—pieces? To always concentrate on one thing, in order to have allthe rest escape? What do I need this Leon Bloy for? And then again . . .8:00 (At the Corner of Las Heras)I dropped by J.’s but he wasn’t home.I was standing on a stone island in the middle of the street. Evening andearly nightfall, lights being born and ﬂickering—and the growing hubbub, carsshoot out next to me, I barely have a chance to look around when two trolley busesturn with a screech, a column of ringing trams approaches, a truck tears out from1960439behind me, I turn around pierced by the whistle of speeding taxis—what madnessis this?—still more of this, faster, a high-pitched, earsplitting tone rises from thebooming, grating, ringing din, swarming with prickly ﬂashes.Speed moving into the deep—moments of such velocity that everythingwailed, and I lost my footing on the island as if swept up by an undertow. . . . I don’tlike and I like Bach. I am a ‘‘profound nonexpert’’ of painting. He said ridiculousthings. . . . What time is it? It’s unfortunate that I lost the letter in French about thetranslation, when I told M. to leave the table . . . it’s good that it happened this way. . . but too bad that . . . What a crater! . . . I have no luck with . . . That bill . . .Chlorine—God, save me from the river surrounding me from the outside and theeven worse river that rushes in my center—from the inner whirlpool—from mydissipation into a thousand moments. From my own haze! My dust cloud! Fromthe ﬂurry that I am. But I do have a—calm—hand in my pocket.But what about the hands of these people speeding by in vehicles! Calm.Resting . . . on knees. . . . And the hand in Querandi? What does it do? And whatwould happen if I knelt before it? If I fell to my knees before a hand? On this island. . . here . . . Well. Yes . . . But what for? No, I will not do this. Of course not, fromthe beginning I knew that I would not do it.8:15 (In the Tram)I would call this groping along the peripheries in search of . . . A constanttoiling on the borderline in order to . . . An attempt to build . . . An attempt(unsuccessful, as always, as all attempts) to raise there, farther away, some kind ofaltar, to whatever, in any old place . . . Ah, this kind of grabbing onto any old thing!The hand of the waiter from the Café Querandi!8:30 (In the Restaurant Sorrento)The waiter comes to the table, I choose snails à la marinera and a carafe ofwhite wine, but his left hand is at rest, just like the one in Querandi, although thishand of his doesn’t concern me at all—it is important only insofar as it is not thathand. . . . I thought about this a little for my amusement . . . and it amused me thatthat hand had caught hold of me so easily . . . and also that it grips me harder thanthis amusement.440Volume 2To the left and the right the bourgeoisie. The women are putting cadavermeat into the openings of their mouths and moving their mandibles—this goes totheir gullet and alimentary canal—they make a face as if they were sacriﬁcingthemselves—and again open the opening to put in . . . The men operate knives andforks—among other things their calf muscles are nourishing themselves in theirtrouser legs, exploiting the workings of the alimentary organs . . . and it wouldreally be strange to conceive of the work of the persons gathered here as the feedingof calves! . . . ? . . . But the apparatus of their movements is set down to the tiniestdetail, these manipulations have been shaped by centuries—reaching for a lemon,buttering pieces of bread, talking in between swallowing, pouring or serving with aconversation on the side, with a crooked smile—the uniformity of movementalmost as if it were from the Brandenburg Concertos—and here one sees humanityrepeating itself without respite. A room ﬁlled with grub, revealing itself in endlessvariations, like a waltz ﬁgure taken up by dancers—and the face of this room,focused on its eternal function, was the face of a thinker.Yes, but—oh God—this is Sorrento!This is not Querandi!8:40 (In the Restaurant Sorrento)Why do I feign anger?Why should it bother me that this is not Querandi?And why am I clinging to his hand like a drowning man—I’m not drown-ing, am I? I admit that the hand means absolutely nothing to me. I do not knowthat waiter personally. A hand like so many other hands . . . 9:00 (On Corrientes Street)I adore the thing that I myself have elevated. I kneel before the thing thathas no right to demand of me that I kneel before it—consequently, my kneelingderives only from me.My anger is the anger of that sea—an unending expanse, a movementunencompassed by anything—but my secret is the fact that I am located in realitytwice. Because I walk along Corrientes Street in Buenos Aires having eaten mysupper in the restaurant Sorrento. Yet at the same time, I am there, on the open,1960441open, open, and roiling sea! Tossed by tossing spaces . . . I am on Corrientes and, atthe same time, I am in the darkest, interstellar abysses—alone in space! I have justhad a pretty good supper and I am cast into inﬁnity, like a shout. . . .Bah! I chose a hand in Querandi simply to grab hold of something, to feelin relation to something. . . . As a point of reference . . . I chose it precisely for thereason that it has no meaning . . . all directions, places, and things are equally goodin my boundlessness, where there is nothing except motion that is becoming. Ichose it from the billion things that surround me, but I could have chosen some-thing else. . . . Only now I would not want it to do something to me! To do withme—or to do to me. . . . Am I no longer alone? Am I already one-on-one with thewaiter’s hand, which I have chosen . . . are the two of us together?9:10 (Corrientes Street)I do this only to show how rapacious this parenthetical hand can be ingrasping (parenthetically). For my amusement.9:15 (Corrientes)
Gombrowicz felt that he had the right to a metaphysical tempest, to a cosmiccatastrophe and a transcendental spine tingle. On the condition, however, thathe not betray the everyday.He felt that he had the right to sail on the open sea on the conditionthat his foot did not leave solid ground, this ground here, in Buenos Aires.
9:20 (In a Bar on the Corner of Lavalle and San Martin)A discussion with Gomez on the subject of Raskolnikov (because one ofthem, Goma, or perhaps Asno, is reading The Possessed).My view: that in Crime and Punishment, there is no drama of the con-science, in the classic, individualistic sense of the word. This is what I lectured tothem about.—At the beginning of the novel—says Gomez—Raskolnikov commits acrime. At the end of the novel he voluntarily turns himself in to the police andconfesses the crime. What is this if not his conscience?442Volume 2I: —Not so simple, niños! Look closer. . . .Raskolnikov does not experience pangs of conscience. In the last chapter itis clearly stated that he regretted only that he ‘‘was unsuccessful’’—this he consid-ered his sole transgression and in the throes of this guilt, no other, he bowed hishead before the ‘‘absurd’’ sentence that overtook him.If he lacked conscience—what force possessed him therefore to give him-self into the hands of the police? What sort of force? The system. The system ofalmost mirrored reﬂections.Raskolnikov is not alone—he is situated in a certain group of persons, Sonia. . . the investigating magistrate . . . his sister and mother . . . his friend and others. . . that is what his little world is like. His own conscience is silent—Raskolnikov,on the other hand, suspects that other consciences will not be silent and that ifthose people found out, they would condemn him as a criminal. He is hazy tohimself, and haziness is allowed everything. But he knows that others see himdistinctly, more sharply though superﬁcially, and, for them, judgment of himwould be possible. Well—for them—he would be something of a criminal? It isfrom this suspicion that a feeling of guilt begins to crystallize, he slowly sees himselfwith the eyes of others and he sees himself a little like a criminal—and this image ofhimself he communicates in thought to the others—and from there return the evenmore distinct face of a murderer and the damning verdict. But this conscience is nothis and he senses this. This is a speciﬁc conscience, arising and growing betweenpeople, in a system of reﬂections—where one man sees himself in the other.Gradually, in proportion to the swelling of a bad self-image after committing thecrime, Raskolnikov makes them his judges more and more—and his guilt outlinesitself more and more boldly. But I repeat, this is not the verdict of his conscience—this is the verdict that has risen from a reﬂection, a mirrored verdict.As for me, I would be inclined to think that Raskolnikov’s consciencemanifests itself in only one thing: when it surrenders to that artiﬁcial, interhuman,mirrored conscience as if it were his rightful conscience. Herein lies the moral:because he who killed another human being now fulﬁlls the dictate born ofhuman association. And he does not ask if it is just.12:10 a.m. (On the Way Home)I could have told them. About the hand. I didn’t.196044312:20 a.m.Yes, yes . . .My good God, the things one says!One says whatever comes to mind. This mechanism of speaking . . . as-tounding! When and how do I plan the sentences I utter! How do I know what Iwant to say, if I do not consider it for a moment in the brisk course of my speech?When beginning a sentence, do I know how it will end? How the words choose andround themselves . . . the thoughts . . . ?Yes . . . But better yet, explain why, in saying so much, you told them nothingabout the hand, about the hand from Querandi?I could have said something. But I didn’t.Whereby it became more secret.And in its own way that reﬂex . . . this reﬂex . . . is a mirrored conscience,created from reﬂections . . . but this is, after all, similar to creating for oneself thehand somewhere on the outside, beyond . . . as if on the strength of the reﬂex. . . .12:30 a.m.How his conscience built itself up (Raskolnikov). Just as this hand is build-ing itself up.It is like a parasite. Now it is feeding on what I said about Dostoevski—itwill not rest until it sucks from my words . . . everything that it needs. . . .For what?Polyp! It sucks, exploits, in order to construct, to construct there, beyondmy limit. . . . It is indefatigable!I have to ﬁnish these notes and send them off tomorrow so that they willmake it to Paris by the sixth.The sixth—the sixth—it is not yet here, it will be, but here it is . . . like thehand!Again!12:50 a.m. (At Home)Where can it be right this minute? Still in Querandi? Perhaps it is alreadyresting and sleeping in some apartment, on some pillow?444Volume 2Futile hopes. There is no way to take advantage of its sleeping, to be rid ofit. . . . The more it sleeps, the more alert it is. The less it is, the more it is.Let us note: It seemed so calm when I saw it for the ﬁrst time, in Querandi. . . but it is becoming more and more possessive . . . and I myself no longer knowwhat could stop it there, on the periphery . . . where I end.

1939–1959.A little history? Polish history? I follow it so little, I seek it so feebly (it peeksin at me)—I look at it from afar, as at a chain of mountains. Should I speak of it?But history is—after all—precisely a viewing from afar!How have these roles ﬁnally organized themselves? Who has lost, who haswon—Poland or the emigration? Where has Poland ﬁnally decided to settle down—in Poland or in ‘‘the hearts of émigrés’’?Admit it: the emigration is one big dud; this 1939 version is a failure.Something broke down in its dynamics—it has not fulﬁlled its historical task.Riddle: what is the difference between an emigration and a can of sardines? Emi-gration does not beneﬁt from hermetic isolation.In the meantime, you (it is obvious to whom this ‘‘you’’ refers) worked onlyfor one thing. An aseptic cleanliness so as not to allow any bacillus! To preserve thepast! To preserve an unadulterated past! To this end you have become Guardians.And the holiest of your shrines is you yourselves, just as when you drove away onthe road to Zalesczyki from that happy twenty-year period. I will not waste wordson well-known topics. Conserve! Preserve! Be a statue changing into bronze, thisdistancing, running away! To live for the past! To live for now so that in the futureone can resurrect the past. Not to allow the least little scratch to appear on thisarmor of loyalty.Existence is like a river—this river, when it encounters obstacles, imme-diately begins to seek other beds and bursts through whatever it can, opening newoutlets for itself sometimes in directions it would never have imagined. Our emi-1960445gration has little in common with a river. It has run into a wall and waits for it totopple over: to this day, it stands and waits. It tries to replace natural movementwith massages. And in the course of twenty years you have not been able to musteranything unpredictable, you have not surprised History with anything. This docil-ity testiﬁes to your good upbringing, but it is incapable of reconciling your Neme-sis, who values tough guys with . . . Never mind, let’s drop this!Politeness! You are cultivated gentlemen!
Wednesday
What has happened in the life of the twenty-year-old written word in exile?Writers? Works? Ideas?I occasionally visit the archboring Argentinean literati, where the conversa-tions begin: —Que nuevos valores surgen entre Vds.? What new talents are appear-ing among us? I could answer this question for hours! Well, because there is JózefMackiewicz, Czes™aw Straszewski, Nowakowski; there is Bobkowski’s prose andBali ´nski’s poetry—all of this was really born in emigration—as were so many trucu-lent publicists, so many other artists, whom one is not allowed to omit. . . . Andwould it be right to forget about all these valuable works which writers prominentbefore the war have added to their achievement? Really! ‘‘The literature of exilehas left a beautiful legacy . . . ,’’ etc., etc. Sure, sure. But . . . from a historicalperspective? . . .As long as we are speaking about history—what sort of historical task standsbefore Polish art and Polish thought?Nothing complicated. Actually, a very simple task: to live, to live at anycost. Not to die! Let us admit that this is quite an elementary program, with a fewadditional points, such as: do not be a statue, do not be a mourner, do not be agravedigger, do not recite, do not repeat yourself, do not inﬂate yourself, do notbelittle yourself, do not thunder and roar, do not make jokes. And most of all let’shave—a revision! A revision of everything we possess and a revision of ourselves,too. If everything around us is changing—how can we alone remain ﬁxed in anundisturbed identiﬁcation with what created us, and which therefore no longer ﬁtsinto the present moment?446Volume 2Friday
In one respect, one has to admit that they were intensive. Their barricadingand holing themselves up in anticommunism, their war with red Poland.At least they were able to muster something in themselves. Except . . . onwhat level does this work take place? There should be, for God’s sake, some sort ofdifference between a political (and propagandistic) anticommunism and the anti-communism of a thinker and poet. The contest between a literature in exile andthe enemy does not necessarily have to be reduced to crying ‘‘thugs,’’ or sneering,wailing, ridiculing, and cursing. There is room, beyond this easy stuff whichquickly absorbs all the ready strategies, for an intellectual and spiritual effort inproportion to the most powerful jolt accorded us since Poland became Poland andworthy of one of the boldest adventures mankind has encountered.But they would have to strike a most painful blow at themselves—withoutthis, not a step forward. They would have to begin by treating communism withgoodwill and even friendship . . . they would really have to feel themselves ‘‘com-rades.’’ And the second part of this self-inﬂicted violence would have to be, asmuch as possible, even more contrary to nature, for they would have to treat theirown persons, as well as everything that formed them, that is, all of their history upto now, which is the history of the nation, with hostility. A triﬂe! Get fraternal withthe Kremlin and push away your most valuable treasures—this is what is beingdemanded of you!How do you propose to get at the enemy without having ﬁrst penetrated hisreasoning in complete goodwill, and without examining his ideal in utmost se-riousness? He must be understood even in his venom and dirt (which are insepa-rable from his virtues)—only then will your blows hit their mark. But perhaps thisexceeds your strength? In that case only cold objectivity and justice remain, whichsee the crimes on both sides of the barricade, a judgment of your own sins so severeit would give you the right to settle accounts with someone else’s.All criticism of communism would also have to be joined to an examina-tion of one’s own conscience, an examination which would not retreat before thetruth. Who of you has been able to do this? Only Mi™osz possessed this coolness—he and Mieroszewski, who introduced a cold sobriety into politics. Besides them?It would be looking for a needle in a haystack to ﬁnd in your twenty-year-old poetry1960447and prose a struggle that steadfastly seeks the opponent on his own turf—seeks,ﬁnds, strikes. Emigré literature has acted differently . . . consistently . . . and,unfortunately, predictably. When they throw you out of your home, what are yousupposed to do? (1) Moan and groan. (2) Reminisce. (3) Inveigh against others. (4)Proclaim your innocence. This program has been implemented and it deprivesour polemic with communism of its class, stature, and creativity.Most of the literature under the leadership of the ‘‘bard’’—(and why not!)—Lecho ´n and the editor Grydzewski serves this purpose. The remainder of thiswriting exists in order for writers to prove that they are still writers—and exactly thekind they were before. Oh, this status quo ante!I am intentionally not being more precise about whom I am referring to as‘‘you.’’ Everyone, with very few exceptions. The truth will out.
Saturday
Moreover I will note that they have not fulﬁlled two fundamental intellec-tual tasks earmarked for them by History: to become more familiar with Marxismand to get closer to existentialism.One might believe that these two do not have much in common—never-theless, it is only the two concepts together that really introduce the epoch. Exceptthat . . . Hegel is as necessary to Kierkegaard as he is to Marx. And you won’t be ableto crack Hegel without the Critique of Pure Reason. This in turn derives a bit fromHume, Berkeley, and further back it would be necessary to know Aristotle andmaybe even a little Plato; even Descartes, the father of modern thought, wouldcome in handy and all this as a prolegomena to phenomenology (Husserl), withoutwhich one cannot read L’être et le néant or Sein und Zeit. I do not want to frightenyou with titles or names. I don’t make a philosopher of myself, as I am a poet and Ihave an inborn abschmack for abstract thought. But these names and titles indicatethe horizon of a second-year philosophy student—and, I ask you, would many ofour thinkers be able to handle this exam? Thus they have nothing to offer. Youwant to ﬁght using your complete ignorance of the modern view of the world andman, of the intellectual development of mankind in the space of two thousandyears, with a muddled head on the subject of the most crucial moments of humanconsciousness—this is what you want to ﬁght with? One senses in everything you448Volume 2write the lack of exactly this most general philosophical orientation, you know allthe letters of the alphabet, except your ABC’s.It is not really a matter of intellect, however—one has to listen and to feelone’s way into the newness of the world that is coming into being, into its taste,style, rhythm, passion. These artists weren’t tempted. The emotional breach be-tween this group of consistent conservatives, buttoned to the last button, andmodernity (I know that this word is forbidden and that in saying it I may be accusedof snobbery) has the proportions of the Cologne cathedral.Catholicism! Well, what is one to do, Catholicism! He who knows every-thing and listens to all the rest between yawns . . . the blinders on Polish eyes whichdo not allow them a glance sideways. . . . I repeat, I am not an enemy of Catholi-cism, I am an enemy only of its function in our culture and not just as of today. Butyour liberalism, scientism, socialism, etc., are equally poorly acquainted with whatI would call the disposition of the modern sensibility. You simply do not know whatis going on and in which church the bells are ringing. After twenty years of directcontact with the West, you know less about it than people know in Poland!Let us assume that I am mistaken, that existentialism is not worth muchand that Marxism is defeated. . . . Terriﬁc. But how do you want to despise them ifyou know them only superﬁcially?
Monday
Originality has never ﬂourished among Poles. A nation almost always in-seminated, almost never inseminating, which introduced so little into universalculture, did not feel creation, did not understand it. To us, creativity is somethingrather distasteful. In art, we appreciate only good secondhand work.Hence the tragicomic situation when all the Lecho ´ ns were backed into acorner: now you must drag something out of yourself, take a leap, have an inspira-tion, idea, something unexpected and unusual in order to steal the initiative awayfrom History. They replied by reciting all the works they knew up to now plus newones, which were exactly the same, word for word. All in beautiful, cultivatedlanguage, exemplary syntax, dignity and commas intact.I am far from demanding that each member of the Writers Union in1960449London become a ﬁre-breathing volcano. But let at least two or three of them try.Even unsuccessfully.It seems to me that you were doomed by the righteousness of your sufferingand the decency of your intentions. And, then—you are so charming!
Wednesday
In the emigration—said Wittlin—in an instructive lecture entitled ‘‘TheSorrow and Grandeur of Exile’’ given at a congress of the P.E.N. Club in Exile—there almost always occurs a confusion of concepts and criteria. There are no realyardsticks for measuring the true value of a writer’s work. It is mainly sentimentalconsiderations, obsolete myths and the obsolete laws of national aesthetics—ob-served by the old emigration when judging its ‘‘bards’’—that determine this value.This confusion was especially irksome to the Polish emigration during the last war.Wise words. But the less life one has, the more difﬁcult it is for this kind ofnatural selection. Wiadomo´ sci became the ideal expression of a mediocre demiseof the emigration, it would be hard to come by a more polished, pressed, groomed,spruced up, and comme il faut graveyard. Wiadomo´ sci, along with the whole groupof London blithe spirits, snobs, Englishmen, Europeans, foreign affairs deputies,Polonists, aesthetes, connoisseurs. Fear grips me at the thought of what would havehappened if Kultura had not appeared on the horizon by some happy miracle ofdialectics, as an antithesis. Think for a moment how we would look without thisParisian monthly. Mieroszewski, of course, would not have been allowed intoWiadomo´ sci, he would have been sentenced to writing columns in minor news-papers and this most sober and most open mind (which has already attained aprominent place in the history of Polish political thought) could not have gal-vanized and uncorked our eternally bottled up ‘‘conceptions.’’ Not to mentionMi™osz, whose casus is glaring and obvious. Jele ´ nski! I don’t know how it hap-pened, but I think that Jele ´ nski without Kultura would not have become the onePolish publicist and essayist really at home in Europe; he would not have pene-trated the real French elite. Most certainly, because of those ‘‘sentimental consid-erations, obsolete myths, and the obsolete laws of national aesthetics’’ that Wittlinmentions, Jele ´ nski’s supple intelligence, for he knows European literature better450Volume 2than any other Pole, would not have gained entry to Grydzewski’s Olympus and hesimply would not have had a place to begin his literary career. And—so as not tocite any more names—many other new things introduced by Kultura on the social,political, artistic front—where would all of that have gone? And last but not least,how would our coexistence with Poland look—why, Wiadomo´ sci and its group arelike the Great Wall of China—do you remember the resolution of the Writers’Union in London forbidding publishing in Poland, that monumental resolution,the epitome of absolute incompetence?
Wednesday
Why have I broken with the discretion that characterizes me, and why am Isomewhat embarrassing and even downright provocative? I am not doing this forthe fun of it. It is a matter of creating a polarization, a line of demarcation. Allthat is alive has been sitting in the morgue for too long. Life must feel itself alife; itmust experience its own ruthlessness, asperity, vigor, and commence clearing away for itself.
Friday
I will cite Wittlin again:
The writer-exile lives in a restricted society in which it is not easy to create, letalone publish, revolutionary works. A restricted society such as this most will-ingly lends an ear to that which it has long known. . . . Therefore, it is difﬁcultfor an émigré writer to impose his own taste and novelty on the emigration.Woe to him if he yields. Because if, in a normal society each artist isthreatened by the danger whose name is ‘‘desire to please,’’ that danger is onehundred times greater in a restricted, ghetto-like society. . . .
There you have it! And one should not ingratiate oneself, this would not behealthy in a ‘‘constricted, ghetto’’ society. Better would be the brusqueness ofhonesty, even though it might not be to the taste of those who for two decades havesprawled in their sinecures, taking advantage of the fact that ‘‘a constricted societysuch as this most willingly lends an ear to that which it has long known.’’1960451The dividing line! The line between movement and the ‘‘feigning’’ ofmovement!
Saturday
What a shame that we don’t have a Sandauer! He would come in handywith his ‘‘No Reduced Fares’’ stamp. At least Poland was able to come up with aSandauer—this alone indicates how far they were able to surpass the immobileshallowness of the emigration.How so? Surpassed? They, bound, and you, in completely unhamperedfreedom? Impossible! Irritating! Indeed! As one can see, prison is not the worstplace for a spirit that becomes vigorous only under lock and key. Whereas it is soeasy to dissolve in the boundlessness of freedom—like a piece of sugar that hasfallen from a ship into the ocean.In a certain sense Poland and the emigration are sick with the same disease.For if the emigration sinks into artiﬁciality, as a consequence of its being cut offfrom the nation, then it is also true that artiﬁciality in a more brutal dose wasimposed in Poland by a theory as rapacious as it was false. In emigration one existsin a void, bereft of the contact with life that tests and renews. In Poland everythingis also tainted with ﬁction, but because it has been separated from the world, fromthe free play of values, Poland has turned into a closed system, subject to speciallaws. In these conditions it is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd criteria in art: everything there, inPoland, or here, with us, that invokes reality, life, truth, not the relative andprovincial but the universal and ultimate truth, is valuable and even priceless;everything that in its essence is owed to the existing state of affairs and rests ondeceit as on a throne is miserable and ﬂat, cunning and mediocre.Before me on the table is Sandauer’s book No Reduced Fares, containinghis all-out attack on contemporary Polish writing. I said ‘‘all-out’’ even though theblood-thirsty Sandauer limits himself to devouring Adolf Rudnicki, Jerzy Andrze-jewski, Jan Kott, and a few others. But basically this book is, from ﬁrst page tolast (it doesn’t matter whether it is glorifying Bruno Schulz or trouncing Kott), ablow aimed at the game—the game according to the agreed-upon rules of Polishliterature.Didn’t he get a little carried away when butchering Rudnicki? Is Andreze-452Volume 2jewski really so awful? The issue is not them but rubbish as such and the dubiousdistinction of this literature. I am not inclined (like Sandauer) to blame theirshabbiness exclusively on the period of muzzle and terror. First of all, this all endedquite a while ago, and, second, art, being a metaphor par excellence, bears all kindsof inquisitions quite well. Third, it would probably be enough if art in Poland, evenwithout touching politics, would manage to produce even one truly profound andauthentic individuality—this immediately infects, forces people to exert them-selves, dictates a standard. Their miseries are a result not so much of their situationas of their being unable to look their situation in the face. Yet how do you wantthem to look it in the eyes, if they have gotten so entangled in it? They didattempt—for all their concern about the spiritual and artistic values they represent—to come to terms with the situation somehow, which, after all, entre nous soit dit,worked in their favor to a great degree by removing the competition and introduc-ing a discount fare. The only recipe for good writing is to get at reality throughconvention, to get at the ultimate reality via conventional reality. But they? Soentangled, so embedded in their own history, steeped in it up to their ears, they, theactors in this play—how were they to go about acquiring distance? Even theenemies of communism, such as H™asko, are embedded in communism for—in anartistic sense—they live off of it . . . and Sandauer was right to include in his book abrief exposé of the career of this talented author, touchingly helpless, incapable ofgetting his troubles under control intellectually, disoriented, primitive, doomed toelaborate on a few naive themes. H™asko: interesting, but only as a product ofcommunism—also a son of everything shoddy and one of its constituent parts.If this is how it is, why did I say that they have outstripped the emigration?Because they—in contrast to you, here—are tired of the rubbish. San-dauer’s tone—that cool determination in unmasking—is not a coincidence but anecessity, and he must have many, many readers in Poland (sometimes a book isnot printed in large editions, but its tone is passed from mouth to mouth like‘‘village news’’). Sandauer does not altogether appeal to me, he is too cerebral, hisintellectualizing is dry, without suppleness, and sometimes even seems lame, butone must admit that no one has inserted his ﬁnger more unceremoniously intotheir throbbing wound. He said what could no longer remain unsaid; he foundwithin himself stores of honesty, ruthlessness, harshness which are absolutely es-sential and vital for the future development of Polish literature. It is not just a1960453matter of this or that particular opinion, which may sometimes be wrong. In thisbook, for the ﬁrst time since the war, one hears the voice of a clerc, returningPoland to Europe (which does not mean: to European capitalism).

For Gombrowicz, Sandauer in Poland was what Jele ´ nski was on European soil.Jele ´nski and Sandauer: both pushed him to the top with indefatigable industry,which he admired (because it was practically inconceivable to him that onecould muster something more than acknowledgment—which obligates one todo nothing—in relation to someone else’s works). Nor could he conceal fromhimself that Ferdydurke is mentioned a lot in the pages of No Reduced Faresand that, for Sandauer, it became a point of departure in his offensive on Polishwriting. And, entre nous soit dit, a book that devastated those around it toestablish the ruthless preeminence of Gombrowicz’s achievement as a writercould not help appealing to him.Did it please him? Why, certainly. So what? Was this reason to refrainfrom talking about Sandauer? He felt that it would be enough to let these debtsbe known in order to purify himself. When this complex was admitted, it lostits sting.After all, he saw more and more clearly that his understanding withSandauer was far from perfect, encompassing only part of his works and hisperson. One could not expect Sandauer to have the extraordinary receptivenessand sensitivity that allow Jele ´ nski to grasp things in midﬂight—Sandauer was aspecies of beetle, an individual marching to his own drummer, a mastodon,crustacean, monk, hippopotamus, crank, inquisitor, cactus, martyr, crocodile,sociologist, and avenger. This lone man took from him—from Gombrowicz—only what ﬁt him and in the long run, who knows, one even had to count on thepossibility that this ally might change into the enemy . . . this turn of events,although not too likely, was not out of the question. . . .

To me, it is clear: in spite of its impoverishments, the higher stratum inPoland is superior to the émigré elite in matters of intelligence and enlightenment.454Volume 2While the emigration has wasted the bulk of opportunities and riches thatthe wide latitude of the West has given it, the Poles have at least been able to exploitsome of their advantages. What sort of advantages? First, the inner, secret, almostconspiratorial, individual maturing that inevitably occurs in an atmosphere ofbeing stiﬂed, in an atmosphere of violence, persecution, and complication—not tomention catastrophes, horrors, blows, defeats. All of this taken together has sharp-ened them as much as the softness and monotony of the emigration (whose onlystruggle is the struggle for money) have made émigrés emblems of the idealbourgeoisie. The affability of the ofﬁcial tone in Poland is accompanied by anawful dissonance somewhere deep inside—a dissonance as dynamic as it is bitter.Disillusionment—a series of disillusionments—is probably the advanced instruc-tion they have received.Let us also remember the renewal that is always brought by a revolution,even a bungled one. The social reconstruction had to bring with it changes inintellectual and spiritual perspectives. The new materialistic evangelicism wasafter all a jolt, a jolt out of the narrowness of Catholic tradition, which had becomeso inhibiting in Poland that only now is the legacy of the Jesuit boarding schoolbeing eliminated. This is how Marxism has compromised the Church while com-promising itself, after having revealed itself as no less rigid and dogmatic. On theother hand, the Nation has also been questioned (I am speaking of the upperclass), because its weakness has been revealed and because in the new politicalconstellation of Poland the issue of nationality has less and less to say. It seems,therefore, that on the corpses of Dogma, of Philosophy, and of Ideology onlyScience and Technology can proclaim their kingdom. But Technology and Sci-ence are barely inching along in Poland, something is plugging along here andthere—too clumsily to be able to become even the semblance of life’s profounddaily contents. Degradation is common, it has encroached upon all areas and ithas disposed of all the gods—hence their disillusionment, hence their wisdom.This wisdom, however, is speciﬁc . . . not to be revealed. For politicalreasons? Not only. These people are like children who would like to build a newediﬁce with only a pile of blocks left over from a lot of previous birthdays; theybuild something inharmonious, with castle vaults, the facade of a Swiss house, afactory chimney, and a church window. Poland is full of clutter and her intellec-tual life consists of ﬂinging platitudes at one another—those from before the war1960455and those that were inserted into their mouths after the war. In listening to theselearned discussions we sense a poor education, even a poor upbringing, but most ofall the absence of a style that would allow these ﬁne talents to achieve somethingevery once in a while—everything is a junkyard, chaos, ineptitude, and dirt. Somuch dirt! So much garbage! Nevertheless, the underground pressure of theirrestless, tragic, brutal, disillusioned intelligence seems to me inﬁnitely strongerthan before the war, and will probably one day make its way to the surface.

Art is aristocratic to the marrow, like a prince of royal blood. It is therefutation of equality and the adoration of the superior. It is a matter of talent, evengenius, or superiority, prominence, uniqueness; it is also the harsh creation of ahierarchy of values, cruelty in relation to that which is common, the selection andperfection of that which is rare, indispensable; it is, ﬁnally, a nurturing of per-sonality, originality, individuality. No wonder, then, that the magnanimously en-dowed art of the People’s Democracies is a mountain that gives birth to a mouse.This costs cool millions and all this ‘‘production’’ boils down to nothing but gab.Gab. When I happen to cock my ear in the direction of Poland, this is whatI hear—gab and more gab. They are terribly garrulous. Their books are like theirliterary press, and their literary press is like their coffeehouses—everything is drip-ping with chitchat, bursting with blather. I don’t know a single work of theirs that Icould recognize as being born in silence. Nor do I know a single author (except formaybe two) about whom I could say: he doesn’t write on the sidewalk or in a caféattached to the sidewalk. Even the works of people who have been isolated forsome time have in them this peculiar sociability, characteristic of persons who donot own their own apartments (spiritually speaking; I am not speaking of a kitchenand bathroom). Listening to the café hubbub they create, one could claim that alltheir voices have more or less the same intensity; they also have the same ‘‘color,’’ asmusicians say. There is such a cacophony of voices and instrumental groups thatthe trumpet is indistinguishable from the ﬂute and the double bass ﬂows togetherwith the oboe. Altogether it sounds like an orchestra, pardon me, like a café—yes,456Volume 2there is no question about it, modern Polish literature is not only great babble but agreat ‘‘locale’’ with pastries, demitasses, and souls.I would make a face at them today and call out ‘‘tsk, tsk’’—because, for-merly, before the war, for the heroic Polish left, I was a coffeehouse literatus worthyof condescension . . . but now the roles have been reversed. It is obvious that theirtruths have been hammered out over a demitasse (hey, do people still say this?),that their poems are washed down with tea, that their essays are like a layer cakeand their novels like ‘‘napoleons’’ (hey, do you still use this word?). Not that theyare too sweet. The matter is more peculiar than that. As you know, a man feelsdifferent whether he is, for example, in a dark forest, in a manicured Frenchgarden, or on the fortieth ﬂoor of an American skyscraper. For an expert like myself(for I have worn my teeth down to the gums in cafés), there can be no doubt thattheir sense of well-being is the sense of well-being of café habitués. There is inthem, how shall I put it, this little aftertaste . . . the limits of their personality areexactly the distance ‘‘from one table to the next.’’ In vain would one seek in them aholy thicket or the expanse of a meadow. There isn’t a penny’s worth of thedramatic ferocity of a loner like Kant or Proust. They lack the metaphysical anxietyborn of a concentrated silence. They lack the religion revealed in a burning bush.They lack the method, hygiene, discipline that characterizes science laboratories.Each of them ends close by—where his neighbor begins—they are limited by eachother, by their own company. Of course they know all this and they do what theycan not to be a café; but their spiritual convulsions exist so that they not be a café,the result of which is that they again become a café, inside out. A vicious circle.Even before the war, the excessive domestication of literature in the cafésZiemia ´nska, Ips, Zodiac, etc., was disturbing. A café is dangerous because it createsits own world; a café, even a Parisian café, is always local and so provincial.Sandauer’s achievement will go down as the discovery of the forbidding percent-age of cafés and, what goes with it, the provincialism in the work of an eminentPolish writer, but in my opinion it would be better to praise this writer for acreativity that is so typical and representative. How is one to be cured? There isonly one means of escape. Immediate departure abroad, to the other side of anyborder (as long as one gets across). This is inopportune because of the difﬁcultiescaused by the authorities in getting a passport—but let us not forget that a writercan leave on a book, like a witch on a broom. Do you get my advice? A Polish artist,1960457if he wants to achieve something, has to leave, leave spiritually, leave withoutbudging an inch—and he has to leave for the mountains. The Polish plain is inevery respect moving but for an artist there is nothing like mountain air, sharp,sharp mountain air, accompanied by such unevenness of terrain that someone isalways looking at someone else from above or below—is this clear? Move out (inspirit, not budging from the spot) into a blessed land, which swells beneath yourfeet, stiffens, grows and rises. Or in other words: if you want to cultivate art, youhave to lean on art, move out to seek the highest art of Europe, and recover in itsnature your own nature as an artist and bind yourself to it. . . .I would refrain from these suggestions if communism had not revealed artand literature to be in a state of such advanced sclerosis . . . one must admit thatalthough communism is not always sclerotic, in such ‘‘cultural’’ matters it suffersfrom an incurable stiffness and clogging of the arteries. In other areas it is innova-tive—here it is heavy, blind, unintelligent. If Communists wanted to approach artless brutally and dully, they would have to understand that one cannot change art inits very essence—that it, like certain shrubs, is a high climber. There is little inhumanity that is as uncompromising as the artist. It would be wisest, therefore, toleave artists in peace and allow them to be like the aristocracy of old, in keeping withtheir vocation. This kind of aristocracy is conceivable and acceptable within Marx’ssystem. But Communists preferred to ‘‘level’’ art by stomping on its face. Too bad,but in these ‘‘civilized’’ conditions only one thing remains—to emigrate in spirit asquickly as possible—but, of course, I give this advice only to the two or threeauthentic princes divinely ordained, the remaining thirty thousand democrats,engaged in dabbling, can do what they want, because it is of no great importance.
Tuesday
All of the (monstrous) Communist disasters in treating art derive from theirincapacity to understand its reasons for being.The power of art, its capacity to resist, its perpetuity which always re-nourishes itself, derive from the fact that the individual expresses himself throughit. Man. Individual man. Science is collective just as reason and knowledge are notprivate property; truths arrived at by reason, abstract truths, are passed from genera-tion to generation and a scholar is like an architect who adds one more brick to the458Volume 2ediﬁce built by his predecessors. Philosophical, conceptual truths are no lessabstract and no less Communist—they are thereby common (as long as the phi-losopher does not become an artist, which often happens).On the other hand, when you step onto art’s terrain—watch out, Commu-nists! For this is private property, the most private property man has ever achievedfor himself. Art is so very personal that each artist begins it from the very beginning—and each creates it in himself, for himself—it is the vent for one existence, onedestiny, a separate world. In its effects, in the mechanisms of its effects, it is social;in its conception and spirit it is individual, separate, concrete, unique.What would happen if you liquidated art, Communists? Nothing, you say?Human progress would not be hindered, there would be no void, no silence, theloud voices of Science, Philosophy, the Party, maybe even of Religion would stillring out, each day would bring new discoveries. Surely. . . . But are you reallyprepared for one major sacriﬁce? From then on, there would be no way of knowingwhat a man thinks or feels. What the individual man thinks or feels.It would be unbearable. But why shouldn’t Communists be capable ofacknowledging a separate place for art and respecting its needs? They will needthis kind of preserve, they could allow (others, but also themselves) this kind ofprivate property and this kind of aristocracy. Why don’t they do this? I don’t know.Doesn’t the established pattern allow it?

Councillor Pod´ srocki of Trans-Atlantic reminds a person I know, I am told,of a comical personage, the councillor Korczy ´ nski. This Korczy ´ nski was, around1947, the secretary of the Legation that sailed into Buenos Aires from Warsawunder the leadership of Minister Szumowski. A secretarial ﬁgure, bureaucraticallydiplomatic and Galician to boot—extremely good material for vaudeville. And hewasn’t the only one at the consulate who roused one’s sense of humor.

Ah, a Polish teacher! In answering Mr. Grabowski, I thought he was a merecolumnist, even though he had the air of a teacher of Polish. And my feelings1960459probably did not lead me astray, because his reply brought the proud admissionthat he was the son of a professor (history of literature) and then—how inestimable,delightful, and typical the passage—that he was used to evaluating a work of artmethodically, according to three considerations (I no longer remember what theywere, but I read them with great enthusiasm).Alicja Lisiecka, who carries on about Sandauer in Nowa Kultura (‘‘Jubileeof Criticism’’), also, unfortunately, smells like a Polish teacher. Her piece is a littletoo smart-alecky, academic, and professorial, like a bullet that misses its mark. (P.S.Strange. Another article in jZycie Literackie, also about Sandauer, also schoolmar-mish and like a schoolteacher’s, but not by Lisiecka but Lisicka and not Alicja butTeresa. What is this: a holy professor in two persons? Could it be that she splitsherself in two like an amoeba?)

Byron and Debussy. These revolutionaries from years ago are worth envy-ing. They at least had something speciﬁc to destroy, they had a distinct, solemnenemy they could strike down. In our times the revolution has penetrated every-thing and there is no longer anything shocking. The scandal has exhausted itself.But today Byron’s letters are richer in dynamite than Childe Harold’s Pil-grimage, than The Corsair, than the works that were intended to be revolutionary.And Debussy? Doesn’t his conservative stubbornness, his peculiar classicism, ap-peal to us at least as much in his partiturs as his ‘‘modernism’’ does?
Sunday
Guitarra was taken to colimba. ‘‘Guitarra,’’ as the name itself indicates, is aguitarist, whom I came to know in Tandil when he played Bach and Suite en ré,whose author is probably Visée. And ‘‘colimba’’ is military service. Later, duringsuccessive meetings, I read from his face all the horrors of the torture—which inArgentina lasts for well over a year in the army and two in the navy.Is it possible to reconcile the barracks with democracy? With constitutionsguaranteeing personal freedom and dignity? With the declaration of the rights ofman? They put a twenty-year-old boy, who has committed no crime, into this460Volume 2concentration camp, worse than a prison (because in prison there is no sergeantwho takes you for a gallop; because prison, unlike the barracks, is not determinedto break down your being; because prison is incarceration but not harassment dayand night). One or two of their most beautiful years must be given away to theSergeant. They are lucky if they come away unscathed (and no one pays repara-tions). The inevitability of this ordeal poisons their youth long before the fatal date.How does one explain that the wrong of some individual Dreyfus or someother lucky fellow becomes a problem of conscience and provokes something likea civil war, while annually depriving ten million boys of their most elementaryrights (sometimes together with their lives) gets swallowed so easily by our human-itarian throats? Why does no one protest, neither the parents, nor they themselves,nor, ﬁnally, any of these sensitive consciences of humanity who are always ready torend their garments.If you are curious to know who is at fault, take a look around . . . yes, it is, itis . . . age (this hidden spring of social life). Twenty years old! Colimba is where twotypes of violence basic to society take place. The violence of the more enlightenedupon the less enlightened and the assault of the older upon the younger. Here anofﬁcer, more aware, grabs half-illiterates by the throat, here the older grabs theyounger by the hair. We live tempered lives, in an atmosphere of mutual respect,but somewhere there must be a little cranny where the superior meets the inferior,the older the young, oh, just like that, without inhibitions or restraints.Flor, Marlon, Goma, and others, already liberated, told anecdotes from thecolimba yesterday—hair-raising!What would happen if a law was announced sentencing a person whocompleted, let us say, his fortieth birthday to prison for a year? The general protestwould lead to revolution in a second. But the colimba? Well, people have beenused to it for centuries. And, after all, this age . . . The age of complete, yet stillchildish physical prowess makes it easy, enables . . . the concentration of many livesin the ﬁst of one ofﬁcer, as if it were the ﬁst of a demigod.
Tuesday
Today I awakened in the delight of not knowing what a literary award is,that I do not know ofﬁcial honors, the caresses of the public or critics, that I am not1960461one of ‘‘ours,’’ that I entered literature by force—arrogant and sneering. I am theself-made man* of literature! Many moan and groan that they had difﬁcult begin-nings. But I made my debut three times (once before the war, in Poland; once inArgentina; and once in Polish in emigration) and none of these debuts spared meone ounce of humiliation.I thank Almighty God that he got me out of Poland when my literarysituation began to improve and cast me onto American soil, into a foreign tongue,into isolation, into the freshness of anonymity, into a country richer in cows than inart. The ice of indifference conserves pride quite well.Thanks be to you, too, Almighty God, for the Diary. One of the mostdramatic moments in my life happened ten years ago when the ﬁrst fragments ofthe Diary were being born. Oh, how I quaked! I cast off the grotesque language ofthe works I had written to that point as if I were taking off armor—this is howvulnerable I felt in the diary, I was so overcome by the fear that I would emergepale in these simple words! Was this not my fourth debut and the most dangerousof them all? But afterward! What security when it turned out that in a tight spot Icould comment on myself—that is exactly what I needed: to become my owncritic, my own annotator, judge, director, I needed to deprive others of the powerto decree sentences . . . that is when I truly won my independence!I owe much to a few writers who supported me, beginning with BrunoSchulz, who is very well known today. But it was only when I really started to writein the Diary that I felt I was wielding my pen—a wonderful feeling, which I gotfrom neither Ferdydurke nor any other of my works of art, which seemed to writethemselves . . . somewhere beyond me. . . . From then on, my pen began to serveme. . . . It was as if I were accompanying my art all the way to the point where itdropped into another person’s existence and became hostile to me.

Grombrowicz felt that exceptionally malicious circumstances forced him tosuch directing of his personal drama in the Diary (although perhaps it was also justiﬁed by the spirit of his writing, in which the idea of directing and the ﬁgure
*‘‘Self-made man’’ in English in original.462Volume 2of the director appear so often)—therefore, no one ought to reproach him forthis. He wrote in conditions that were downright stiﬂing—gagged in Poland,cutoff from the world at large by his exotic Polish, choking in an émigré narrow-ness. This is how his unfortunate works were born—not easy, after all, not easyto the point that even in the very center of Paris they would have to ﬁght hard forrecognition.It is a measure of the unbelievable shallowness of the Polish minds withwhich he had to contend in the suffocating emigration that even his Diary, so much easier to understand than his earlier works, did not often penetrate theirbrains. He was labeled ‘‘egotistical’’—and Schluß! that settled it! It neveroccurred to the majority of these émigré readers and critics—scholars of Polishliterature, poets, writers, intellectuals—that one could speak about oneself invarious ways, that his ‘‘I’’ in the Diary is not the ‘‘I’’ of a trivial egoist, or a naiveNarcissus, but of someone who realizes what is going on . . . that if this isegotism, then it is a methodical, disciplined egotism testifying to a high andcold objectivity. They saw only the pattern. And furthermore the outcry: —Ego-tist! Conceited! Tactless! Aggravating, angry, unlikable!It is true that Gombrowicz sometimes teased the emigration on pur-pose. —I tease it so that it will not throw itself at me—he once said; for heclaimed that Stupidity is an exceptional beast, one that cannot bite if it isyanked hard by the tail.

Beethoven’s form and its drama in history.For some years I have been existing beyond music. I have become unaccus-tomed to it. As for Beethoven, I devoured him with pleasure in my youth just likeeveryone else, but later, what do you expect, he had settled in my ear too much anda time came when his ‘‘phrase’’ came close to being trite for me. And all theserevelations—Beethoven’s ‘‘thought’’ and his ecstasies and demonisms and lyricismsand the very outline of the theme, harmonies, modulations, transformations—Ialready had everything in me for good . . . only echoes reached me from the stage.1960463Nevertheless a few months ago, I began listening, by accident, to his Quar-tet in F Minor, the eleventh—and I don’t know if I was particularly craving musicthat day or if perhaps I was simply won over by the polyphonic riches of the quartetas a string group, always so inexhaustible . . . immediately the next day I boughtmyself records with these quartets of his . . . and I drowned. E-ﬂat major, E minor,C major, C-sharp minor, F major, A major, G major—quartets! Sixteen quartets! Itis one thing to dip occasionally into one of them, in passing, and another to stepinto the building, to immerse oneself, to wander from hall to hall, wander in thegalleries, take in the vaults, examine the architecture, uncover the inscriptions andfrescoes . . . with a ﬁnger to one’s lips. Form! Form! It is not him I look for, thebuilding is not full of him, but his form, which I get to know in the course of thisgradual self-composition of adventures, changes, acquisitions—similar to creatureshuman and nonhuman from ancient fairy tales. As if through a fog, constantlylosing my way and with a ﬁnger to my lips, I move from ‘‘adagio molto e messo’’from the seventh to ‘‘molto adagio—andante’’ from the ﬁfteenth, or, too, pensive, Iexamine how and why Haydn’s sun from the time of his youth returns so strangelyat the threshold of death, in the last rondo and in the andante in F major? How andwhy? An unclear question—undelineated answers—dissolved in a musical noise,like the noise of a river—this is not an area of clear contour—and one cannot domore than ask, than answer, while constantly searching with a ﬁnger to one’s lips,constantly losing one’s way.Certainly, if not for that elegant sound of four stringed instruments, if notfor that polyphonic quartet reﬁnement, thanks to which all music that passesbetween these four instruments undergoes an inordinately subtle transformation, Iwould not have gone crazy about Beethoven so unexpectedly. But he also inter-ested me as a problem. . . . I thought: this music is probably one of our greatestcompromises in the area of art . . . its history is the history of the dirty trick that wasplayed on us . . . its history is the history of our defeat . . . and this old, easyBeethoven is one of the most difﬁcult nuts to crack, today, in the day of Schönberg.For in art nothing is as difﬁcult as easiness. For art becomes more and moredifﬁcult in proportion to its development; easiness is then contradictory to itstendency, easiness remains behind, easiness dies, is taken care of—keeping easi-ness alive is then contradictory to the natural evolution of art.And one more thing, before I get to Beethoven: as everybody knows, music464Volume 2is almost exclusively a form, pure form, which develops by itself, with its own logic,from generation to generation. A composer, depending on his era, ﬁnds an existentmusical language with which he must express himself.Let us now take a look at musical form from the Mozart-Beethoven period.Forests, groves, streams and pools, ﬂowery meadows and ﬁelds rustling with wheat—freshness, lushness, youth, spendidly fertile ground—this is natural music, asGod ordained, whose rising force one had to stop. What a wealth of singing! Whata ﬂood of harmony! During those blessed times, O musicians, Form was graciousto people. And Beethoven, happy fellow, arrived in the world exactly at the close ofthis period, when naturalness began to exhaust itself and artistry was gainingmomentum. What a happy moment, musicians! Joining nature and art so attrac-tively, as in his transformation of the sonata form, already fanciful and disciplined,yet still direct, fresh. . . . These idylls of art with nature rarely happen to humanity,and humanity, having once experienced them, does not forget them for longcenturies. . . .But Form wouldn’t be our curse if it allowed this romance to endure forany length of time. It began to fulﬁll its ominous destiny. The virgin soil of Mozartand Haydn began to exhaust itself. Chopin and Wagner understood with horrorthat they could not cultivate the same ground, something repulsive—satiety—stoodlike an angel with ﬂaming sword in their way; they then found other lands whichhad lain fallow—but they turned out to be worse. Unhappy Wagner had to compli-cate his mighty musical invention with the intellect just so as not to follow in thefootsteps of those masters—what an autocatastrophe, musicians! And Chopin, ex-ploiting his discovery—the different treatment for piano—to its maximum, dis-covered his own row from which he did not budge, happy that he possessed at leastthis farmstead. For these people, music begins to contract violently, limit itself,concentrate, make itself difﬁcult, this is no longer Beethoven’s evening stroll buthard labor, digging the well, irrigating the land. When then of Debussy or Stravin-sky, and all the others later, cast out by music, by Form, and even further on, wherethere were clods, crags, fallow ground—laborious, grim effort, in the sweat of one’sbrow, the acquiring of bloody, meager fruits, isn’t this true, musicians? They coulddelude themselves, like Debussy, that they were getting out from under the tyrannyof classical rules into freedom—it is true that these few freedoms, fought for in1960465agony, were accompanied by the growing pressure of Form, but an (already)inhuman and cruel Form, acting against our humanity. Did not this worthy-of-our-pity Debussy say that music should be esoteric and accessible only to the chosen?to specialists?Yes, a glaring example, one of the most glaring in the entire history ofculture, that ‘‘form deforms,’’ turning against man. The history of music of the pastone hundred years is the almost clinical history of suffocation. I do not deny thatthis slow choking of the soft body in the harder and harder armor of form does notlack its lofty and insightful moments—for even wanderers who are exiled by hun-ger from their native land and who take on the desert and wild regions often havestunning experiences, an unusual revelation—the exiled spirit, wandering spirit,attains in such extreme circumstances a store of new and raw material, which onewould search for in vain at home. I do not treat this wealth lightly and evensomeone as good as Schönberg—his face twisted with lack of joy in a feeling oftragic obligation and tragic fate, pushing on toward a complete realization of hisdemonic destiny—ﬁlls me with as much pity as respect. But how far you are, Otorture, from the happy days of Merciful Form. The most scathing absurdity ofthese martyrs is that they do not express what they live. When Form turns againstyou, you experience awful and poisonous states. The pleasure that you desire tocreate torments you and humiliates. Your lungs lack the air that is called joy.Everything becomes an effort and you are like a high jumper who puts the barhigher and higher in order to jump higher still. Mysterious powers force you toseek, not what tastes good to you, but taste, and your shame is that you mustcompletely support and conﬁrm that which is killing you.

Tchaikovsky’s artistic defeat is proof that in art one can neither go back norlower oneself—a backward direction and a downward direction are not allowed.The unbearable stench penetrating his work, of something like the inessentialmixed with something ‘‘that was,’’ ex, buried, and now artiﬁcially blown up, thefeebleness of the melodiousness that has seen its day! And what can one say aboutShostakovich? Folklore, melody, anecdote—no, returning is not allowed! Making466Volume 2it easier is not allowed! One is not allowed to lower oneself! Up, crawl up, withoutrespite, without looking back, even though you might have to break your neck,even though, at the top, there may be nothing but rock.Today Beethoven is an inaccessible yardstick. The most precious thingabout his song derives from the impossibility of its ever being repeated.

This tragic exodus of modern composers is not only a matter of graduallymaking barren our musical ground—everything in our culture, all of its mecha-nisms, counts on this pushing out to the extreme or up to the top. . . . Nietzsche’sand Ortega’s opinions about Beethoven interest me, for example, because I denythem freedom. These are forced opinions, the kind that ‘‘speak themselves’’ as ifagainst the will of the person who utters them. This is a little like a totalitariansystem: everything must support the dominant tendency.Nietzsche (in The Gay Science):He says ﬁrst that vulgarity has visited German music—a bourgeois, revolu-tionary vulgarity, intolerant of ‘‘nobles,’’ especially in their embodiment of espritand élégance. ‘‘If you want to imagine the human being that goes with this music, merely imagine Beethoven as he appears beside Goethe—say, at their encounter inTeplitz: as semi-barbarianism beside culture, as the people beside nobility, as thegood-natured human being next to the good—who is more than merely a ‘good’human being—as the visionary beside the artist, as the man in need of comfortnext to the man who is comforted, as the man of exaggeration and suspicion nextto one who is fair-minded, as the mope and self-tormentor, who is foolishly ec-static, blissfully unhappy, guilelessly extravagant, presumptuous and crude—andin sum, as the ‘untamed human being’: that is what Goethe felt about him andcalled him—Goethe, the exception among Germans. No music of his rank has yetbeen found.’’*Interesting. Because this is, on the one hand, aristocratic, profound, re-ﬁned, but on the other is a glaring lie and quite a coarse simpliﬁcation. To furnish
*From Walter Kaufmann’s translation of The Gay Science (New York: Vintage Books,1974), 159.1960467Beethoven’s music with Beethoven’s nose—to humanize it to the point where italmost has the shape and gesture of the person? One could say to me: how’s this,why you yourself have often said that one must seek the creator behind the work?Yes, but not so simplistically! A creator, in my opinion, should be only ‘‘one pointof reference’’ for the critic, the work can be bound too closely to the creator only bysomeone who does not know how much in art ‘‘the language deceives the voiceand the voice deceives the thought.’’ And in music this kind of naïveté is almostinconceivable because here form reaches the highest degree of objectivity. ThatNietzsche! To make the transformation of a theme in a symphony dependent onthe expression of the eyes or the manner of bowing! To accuse of ‘‘unreﬁnement’’someone capable of reﬁning the fugue! To deny self-control and style to someonewhose profession it was to saturate an aristocratically cool form with emotion! Toimagine that Beethoven, consumed by the most speciﬁc musical assignments,such as the shaping of a theme, the extracting from it of all its possibilities, follow-ing it through tonalities, such as the organization of harmony, in short, all the workof composing, which ultimately relies on drawing out of the musical embryo a fewnew elements of form which then later ‘‘work together,’’ blazing their own trails . . .to imagine that the Beethoven who lived in this kingdom of sound was alsosupposed to be a ‘‘soul’’ in the ordinary sense of the word while he worked!And why does Nietzsche add to the music the not necessarily handsomenose of its creator, instead of adding the music to the nose? Are the variations fromthe Thirty-Second Sonata really supposed to be barbaric because they were com-posed by a barbarian quite shocking when compared with Goethe? It would proba-bly be simpler to recognize that the barbarian who wrote these variations was not abarbarian. The author of the fugue from the Quartet in C-sharp Minor a plebeian?A bourgeois good old boy with the adagio from the Hammerklavier Sonata in hishead? An eccentric dreamer, hammering out the architecture of the Fifth Sym-phony? A simpleton with ideas from ‘‘adagio molto e messo’’?Why does Nietzsche fall apart when he gets to Beethoven?But let us take a look at what Ortega y Gasset, that modern porte parole ofthe latest generation, has to say.‘‘The same distance that exists between Bach and Beethoven exists be-tween the music of ‘ideas’ and the music of ‘feelings.’ ’’‘‘Beethoven takes for his point of departure the real situation in which life468Volume 2places him—the absence of his beloved, or the absence of Napoleon, a spring dayin the country, etc.—this situation unloads in him streams of feelings, sorrowful ortempestuous. . . .’’ ‘‘This same procedure proposed to Bach would be interpreted asimpertinence. . . .’’ And further:‘‘Romantic musicians, including Beethoven, devote themselves to express-ing the coarse feelings that visit the decent bourgeois.’’And he explains that common, lower feelings exist, as well as the higher,more reﬁned ones—that Beethoven is the bard of exactly this inferiority, but thatDebussy is ‘‘a real artist’’; even if he experienced such common, average feelings,he would stiﬂe them in himself, ashamed—he would allow only reﬁned, artisticexperiences deriving from the higher sphere of the spirit to be heard. That is why—concludes Ortega—a musician like Beethoven writes the Pastoral Symphony and a musician like Debussy, The Afternoon of a Faun.It is enough to repeat what I said a minute ago about Nietzsche: why, whenOrtega touches Beethoven, does Ortega fall apart?Is it really ‘‘the absence of a loved one or the absence of Napoleon’’ thatconstitutes a point of departure for Beethoven’s works? So ‘‘common’’ feelings aredeprived of the right to greatness in art? Does Beethoven express feelings in hismusic? Isn’t it really peculiar, bah, even offensive that one speaks about Beethovenin this way? Why do people speak only of him in this way? And how does one arriveat this kind of listening to his music? Why him exactly? Why is Ortega in top form,sensitive, knowing and not stupid when he listens to Stravinsky, but Ortega listen-ing to Beethoven totters down to the level of an ordinary engineer, a romanticlawyer, a sentimental hairdresser, and looks around after his lover, after Napoleon,humanity, destiny, or a stream in the woods? Why, I ask, doesn’t he listen toBeethoven in the same way he listens to Bach?Why? But let us also add that these are not the private perversions of twowise men. The dull-witted, the dull-wittedly malicious approach to this artist be-comes a feature of our times. These commentators! Even Wagner said the ﬁrstthing that came to his mind. In the last chord of the andante from the ThirteenthQuartet these jackasses want to see ‘‘the laughter of Bettina Brentano.’’ Those twomusical Tartarins, Romain Rolland and Herriot, dream of battles, sylphs, gnomes,or even ‘‘giants throwing mountain crags.’’ And particularly repulsive is the fate1960469prepared for the splendid Quartet in A Minor, opus 132. This quartet has beenlabeled the ‘‘convalescent quartet.’’ It was generally agreed that the ﬁrst allegro wasillness; scherzo—the recovery; adagio, molto, andante—the thanksgiving hymn ofrecuperation; the ﬁnal allegro—health and happiness. This precious quartet abouta clouded, desperate sky, whose ﬁrst allegro always gives me a precipitous jolt—namely, that after the modulation there enters another theme—they have dressedin a bathrobe, slippers, nightcap, and stuffed with pills.But these oddities, mistakes, stupidities, or brutalities do not take placeexclusively in the higher strata of the musical world. The average listener’s attitudetoward Beethoven, the attitude of those attending concerts, is tainted with disease.At the beginning, an honest and joyous love, there are no tones of God above himthen, no style grabs you this way. . . . Then the young student experiences his idyllwith form and wallows in delectation. This, however, does not last long . . . thehearing becomes accustomed, satiety follows—too bad, too bad! Splendor be-comes too intimate, it wearies.And together with the melancholy boredom of exhaustion, the pressurestarts to get annoying—from where? From the air—the pressuring, all-pervasivesuggestion that of all the creators it is exactly this one that is ‘‘in bad taste,’’ that istoo easy. . . . A malicious ease turning itself into difﬁculty! Bach, Chopin, Schu-bert, even Mozart—well yes! But not Beethoven! From then on, therefore, musicbecomes a steep staircase leading upward for our student, a difﬁculty that sur-rounds him; it is as if he, in casting off delight, were entering another realm, raw,hard, dry, bitter. And ﬁnally the highest initiation appears, the tragic Moloch andtyrant: Bach!
Monday
Bach is boring! Objective. Abstract. Monotonous. Mathematical. Sub-lime. Cosmic. Cubic. Bach is boring!—This is how the worst of heresies sounds,which can deprive one of respect in the musical world. Take a close look at the priests of Bach’s mass, look them in the eyes:obduracy, concentration in abstraction, severity, just like the one that offered thebodies of young children to the gods.Now is the time to answer the question: why do people want to destroy470Volume 2Beethoven, why is every absurdity allowed as long as it is anti-Beethoven, why is astrangling net woven of naive compliments and reproaches? Is it perhaps becausethey don’t like Beethoven? Quite the contrary: because this is the only music thathumanity has been successful in creating, because it is beguiling. . . .He captivates us and that is why we must revile him.This will be a paradox only for the person unaware of the danger of thesituation—that we are under Form’s sway, which exists according to its own laws,independently of us and our tastes. This form—the musical form in a given case—must develop; therefore it must shatter all of its attainments up to now; andspeciﬁcally those that have enchanted man, those that humanity has fallen in lovewith, those . . . that are riveting . . . and that is why Bach is raised onto a pedestal—because they don’t like him, or they don’t like him too much—and this creates thepossibility of development, here form does not ﬁt man well, here, therefore, some-thing is left to be done between man and form. Modern music, based on Bach, canstill live and progress. And that is why in Bartok’s six quartets, whose ties withBeethoven’s last chamber phase are very strong, Bach dominates in spite of every-thing. And Schönberg?But how sad this is! How unenviable our fate!We are condemned to revile our most genuine delights and to think upother, revolting ones which torment us, which we cannot bear—and, what’s more,we are forced to admire them as if this were our true love—we are artiﬁcial in thisself-abuse, artiﬁcial and poisoned, with a tormenting, repulsive art which we arenot allowed to vomit up!

Ways of listening to the quartets. —Sometimes I try to tie them with anotherage, even with another sex. I try to imagine that the C-sharp minor was composedby a ten-year-old boy or by a woman. I try, too, to listen to the Fourth as if it hadbeen created after the Thirteenth. In order to gain a personal attitude toward eachof the instruments, I imagine that I am the ﬁrst violin, Quilomboﬂor plays theviola, Gomozo is at the cello, and the second violin—Beduino. It is also splendid tolisten to the quartet as if it were one instrument—then one values the expansive-1960471ness of the scale and the richness of color. I think of names for them: the Eighth,for example, I call the ‘‘raspberry’’ (because of the tonation in the ﬁrst allegro) andthe Fourteenth the ‘‘Nietzschean’’ (because it is so borderline). There are nochildish things that will not serve to excite the feelings.

Native Realm (I agree with Mieroszewski) lacks that something which inAristotle is called quid—it doesn’t get to the heart of the matter, doesn’t answerthe question ‘‘what is this about’’ and also ‘‘what is the reason for it.’’ Once Isailed along the Paraná like this: early dawn, neither day nor night, just fog andthe movement of the all-encompassing, rustling water, sometimes a speciﬁc objectwould appear in these whirlpools—a board, a branch—but it made no differ-ence because it was immersed in a thrust so universal that it took away yourconsciousness.Mi™osz, who is immersed in Life and in History, will say that there is nogreater falsehood than the deﬁnition that the only truth is the one that cannot beencompassed. Naturally. Except that . . . in reading Mi™osz I recommend caution,for he is—I believe this—personally interested in blurring contours.To me Mi™osz is one of those authors whose personal life dictates his work.It is not always this way. If my life had turned out differently, who knows ifmy books would have changed. But Mi™osz! Except for his poems, all of his writingis tied to his personal literary situation, that is, to his personal history or to thehistory of his times. Gradually he turned out to be almost the ofﬁcial informanton the subject the East, at least, the Polish informant; all of the prose he has writtento date is devoted to this subject. This is not art for art, this is art for the West.This has its consequences. Among them the fact that if Mi™osz cares for his pres-tige, he cannot be shallower in his information than the French or English; onthe contrary, he must be more profound. And if Mi™osz cares about the produc-tivity of his subject, among other things, he should not deprive it of greatnessor danger. . . .Here already one discerns the outlines of certain pitfalls. . . . Let us add onemore, deriving from the very nature of the East: namely the East has always472Volume 2oscillated between extremes for which the principle of tertium non datur governs.If we do not see the terrible profundity of this, it becomes terrible shallownessinstead. If not loftiness, then ﬂatness. But let us add one more danger, quitetypically Polish, deriving from the intermediary Polish situation, thanks to whichour country is a little bit of a caricature of the East as well as of the West. The PolishEast is an East dying in contact with the West (and vice versa), which results in‘‘something being amiss.’’ Let us then imagine Mi™osz’s troubles when he writesabout Tiger,* for example. The issue is whether or not this Tiger is really a tiger ormerely a meowing tomcat prowling the rooftops. Is there a real riddle to him or ishe one more lush from that fabulous Polish inn called ‘‘Under the Dead Cat andDog’’ (‘‘Under the Dead East and West’’)?Mi™osz’s troubles are augmented by his being from this very same inn. Oneof the most interesting, subtle, and even moving aspects of Mi™osz’s prose is hispersonal tie to the Polish ﬂea market—one feels that for all of his Europeanism, heis one of them. . . . While recently admiring Wajda’s wonderful directing in Ashesand Diamonds, I thought about Mi™osz and his Polish homeland. How difﬁcult it isto write a synopsis of Native Realm because one is its son and come what may, onesails on its waves, immersed in its murmur and fog. . . .But the strong point of Native Realm and a guarantee of its modernismshould be nothing else except that here it is not a Pole writing about Poland andthe East, but a man writing about the Pole in himself and about ‘‘his’’ Europe. Aprogram like this is almost Husserl or Descartes. Yes, except that they were philoso-phers and did not scorn abstraction, whereas Mi™osz-the-artist and existentialistfears it like wildﬁre, because he knows that it kills art. He avoids formulas, and sothere is no way that he is going to get out of the river to have a look at it from theshore; he immerses himself in its muddied waters, he engages himself personallyin his description all the time and then he stops being a man; he again becomes aconcrete Mi™osz. . . . And this is where the balancing act of this scrupulous writerbegins: ‘‘Haven’t I denigrated myself too much?’’ ‘‘Haven’t I raised myself toohigh?’’ ‘‘Haven’t I denigrated them too much?’’ ‘‘Haven’t I raised them too high?’’From wave to wave, from top to bottom, bottom to top—the dialectical seesaw.Noise. River. History.

Roby has come to visit from Santiago. He is the youngest of the ten brothersS. Two years ago I spent a few months in this Santiago del Estero (1,000 kilometersnorth of Buenos Aires)—at the time I looked at all the fads, irritations, and inhibi-tions of this backwater, stewing in its own sauce. . . . The bookstore owned by theso-called ‘‘Cacique,’’ a member of that numerous family S., was the collectionpoint for the spiritual anxieties of this small town, placid as a cow, sweet as a ripeplum with its earth-shaking and earth-making ambitions (I am speaking of theﬁfteen people who met regularly in the Café Aguila). Santiago despises the capital,Buenos Aires! Santiago feels that only in it, in Santiago, is the authentic (legitima)Argentina preserved—that all the rest, there in the south, is an assembly of half-breeds, gringos, immigrants, Europeans—a mix, dirt, garbage.The family S. is a typical specimen of Santiago vegetation, transformingitself with an inconceivable twist into impulse and passion. All of these brothers areof saintly goodness and do not lack that sugarplum sweetness—they are a little likefruit ripening in the sun. At the same time, mighty passions from somewhere, somesubstratum of a telluric character, galvanize them, their torpor gallops, touchedby the madness of reform, creation. Each is a sworn adherent of a different politi-cal tendency, thanks to which the family does not need to worry about the fre-quent revolutions here; whatever happens it will always be the triumph of one ofthe brothers, the communist or the nationalist, the liberal, priest, Peronist. . . .(Beduino once explained this to me.) During my stay in Santiago two of thesebrothers had their very own press organs, published at their own expense by thedozens: one published the intellectual monthly, Dimension, and the second anewspaper whose job was ﬁghting the local governor.Roby . . . Shortly before his visit to Buenos Aires he surprised me—we neverwrote to each other—with a letter from Tucumán in which he asked me to sendhim the Spanish edition of Ferdydurke.
‘‘Witoldo, something of what you say in your introduction to The Marriage hascaught my interest . . . these ideas—immaturity, form—which seem to be thegroundwork of your work and have a connection with the problem of creativity.474Volume 2‘‘Of course I didn’t have the patience to read more than twenty pages ofThe Marriage. . . .’’
Further on he asks for Ferdydurke and writes:
‘‘I spoke with Negro (this is his brother, a bookseller) and I see that you con-tinue to be chained by your European chauvinism; the worst thing is that thislimitation does not allow you to attain the deepening of that, so very interesting,problem of your writing. You don’t seem to understand that the most importantthing ‘currently’ is the predicament of undeveloped countries. From knowledgeof this you could extract basic elements for whatever you intend to do.’’
I am on intimate terms with this puppydom and I let them say whateverthey want. I also understand that for all practical purposes they prefer to attackﬁrst—our relations are far from a mawkish idyll. Nevertheless, the letter seemed tome too smart-alecky—well, how dare he? I answered with a telegram:
to underdeveloped roby s. tucuman—don’t talk nonsense. cannotsend 
ferdydurke.  washington forbids it. native tribes are bannedfrom reading it to retard their development, sentence to eternalinferiority—toldogom.
The telegram was put in an envelope and mailed as a letter—these areactually letter telegrams. Shortly thereafter an answer arrived which addressed meindulgently:‘‘Beloved Witold, I got your short letter, I see that you are progressing, but youare trying to be original unnecessarily,’’ etc., etc. Perhaps it is not worth writing thisbanter—except that life, authentic life, is nothing extraordinarily brilliant and it isimportant to me to re-create it here not in its culminations but exactly in itsaverage, everyday character. And let us not forget that a lion, tiger, or serpent cansometimes be concealed in triﬂes.Roby then came to Buenos Aires and appeared in the barcito, where heofﬁciates almost every evening: a boy ‘‘strong in color,’’ raven-black head of hair,olive-brick complexion, lips the color of a tomato, blinding set of teeth. Some-what slanted and hunched Hindu style, robust, healthy, with the eyes of a cleverdreamer, gentle and stubborn—what percentage of him is Indian? And somethingeven more important: a born soldier, ﬁt for a riﬂe, trenches, a horse. I was inter-1960475ested in whether something had changed in the two years of our separation; hadanything changed?For in Santiago nothing progresses. Every evening the same bold ‘‘inter-continental ideas’’ are expressed in the Café Aguila—Europe is ﬁnished, LatinAmerica’s time has come, we must be ourselves and not imitate Europeans, we willﬁnd ourselves when we return to our Indian traditions, we must be creative, etc.Yes, yes, Santiago, Café Aguila, Coca-Cola, and these bold thoughts, repeated dayin and day out with the monotony of a drunkard who ﬁrst puts out one foot andthen does not know what to do with the other, Santiago—that cow which chews itscud every day, that nightmare in which one runs at breakneck speed, never chang-ing place.It seemed to me, however, that it was almost impossible for Roby to protecthimself from mutation, even partially, at his age, and at one in the morning I wentwith him and Goma to another bar, to discuss things within a smaller circle. Hewent gladly, was ready to talk the night through, and it was evident that ‘‘brilliant,crazy student talk,’’ as iZeromski puts it in his journal, had entered his bloodstream.Generally speaking, they sometimes remind me of iZeromski and his colleagues from the 1890s: enthusiasm, faith in progress, idealism, faith in the people, roman-ticism, socialism, homeland.My impressions from this conversation? I left discouraged and disturbed—bored and amused—irritated and resigned—and as if dressed down, as if they hadtaken me in.This dummy hadn’t appropriated a thing for himself since I had last seenhim in Santiago. He initiated the same conversation he did two years ago, as if itwere just yesterday. Word for word—I saw only that he was better organized in hisstupidity, and therefore more conceited and unyielding. And again I had to listento: Europe is ﬁnished! America’s time has come! We must create our own Ameri-can culture. In order to create it, we must be creative—but how is one to do this?We will become creative when we have a program that liberates our creativepowers, etc., etc. Abstract painting is betrayal, it is European. A painter, writer,should cultivate American themes. Art must be related to the folk, must be withfolklore. . . . We must discover exclusively American issues, etc.I know this by heart. Their ‘‘creativity’’ begins and ends with these declama-tions. What misery and penury—I can count dozens who recited this to me and I476Volume 2never heard anything that could not be summarized in the following groan: ‘‘Weare uncreative, we should do something to achieve originality, personality . . . weshould do something. . . .’’ They don’t see the silliness of this griping. They do notknow, these childish creatures, that creativity is not made to order. . . . They do notsee the grotesqueness of this choir, lowing as far and wide as Latin America:originality, personality. They see only that Europe creates; therefore, they toowould like to do the same—but it has not occurred to them yet that this desire fororiginality is also an imitation of Europe. They have not yet comprehended thecompromise contained in the rhetoric beyond which they are not capable ofmoving. They do not sense the frivolity expressing itself in the fact that they desireto ‘‘live their own lives’’ not from a real need, but only to rival Europe—which isbetter! The naïveté of the postulate they propagate escapes them—that ‘‘we aresupposed to discover and delineate who we are in order to know what we aresupposed to create’’ (for the reverse is true—man, a nation, a continent, only increating ﬁnds out who he is, his creativity precedes him). In short, envy, inferioritycomplex, shallowness, feebleness and muddle.Rubbish. There was no way that I could convince him.—You are a europeo. You are in no position to understand us.Or:—You are not grasping that the consciousness of our historical momentdelineates us in our self-creation and in our subconscious mythology (because, ofcourse, this must all be terribly Toynbee, Spengler, Freud, Marx, Jung, phenome-nology, Heidegger, Sartre, Sorel). Despair! His passion is draped with every singlepaper he has ever read. He is so stuffed with ‘‘thoughts’’ that he has lost his taste,hearing, smell, sight, and touch, and—what is worse—he has stopped feeling hisown feelings.Cairo, China, Bombay, Turkestan, and even the Parisian suburbs andLondon working districts—all that ‘‘thinks,’’ all of the inferiority of the world isimmersed in this kind of ‘‘thinking.’’ How is it that Europe—not this geographic butspiritual Europe—has withstood the onslaught of so many avaricious fermentswhich have but one goal—to reach Olympus or destroy it? And this has a nastytaste—this spiritual superiority and intellect, the fruit of development, cannot counton obedience, respect, and gratitude, but becomes an object of desire, of a wildgreed for its place, its honors. The disturbing taste of this dirty work which replacesgenuine effort (of this they are incapable), a compound of passion and deception.1960477Rubbish. And, let us add, the unheard-of-naïveté which thinks the ‘‘cre-ation of new cultures’’ is easy.This Roby pushed me into the past. Into Nazism. I remember: the samepowerlessness when that Austrian was intoxicating himself on the consolidation ofBrochwicz-Kozlowski (in the train that was taking us from Vienna to Tarvisio), thecrash of a rotten Europe and the impending triumph of a new spirit. 1938. Thesame powerlessness in the face of another language, ‘‘their’’ language. The as-tonishment that rubbish could be so powerful and aggressive. And the naggingsuspicion that the quality of the slogans, truths, ideologies, programs, their mean-ing, their reality, haven’t the slightest signiﬁcance here, as they serve a differentpurpose; the only important thing—to accumulate people, produce masses, masspower, a creative power. Ah, to be nothing else except oneself, only one’s ‘‘I’’—howbeautiful this is! How clear and unambiguous. To stand ﬁrmly on one’s own feet.You know what reality is—your reality. You are far from the blather, din, intoxica-tion, deceit, declamation, terror. . . . During the interwar and wartime period Ilived through the victory of collective power as well as its defeat and breakdown,when again that immortal ‘‘I’’ was reborn. Gradually those fears faded in me—untilhere again, with Roby, it assaulted me with the same evil smell!Not a pleasant discovery. You have the impression that once again a mon-strous plot is being hatched in order to grab you and subject you to the blind forcesof the collectivity and History. Words, ideas, everything then gains another mean-ing, morality, science, reason, logic, everything, everything becomes the weaponof some other, superior idea, everything is masked, everything desires to conqueryou, possess you. What sort of idea is this? You seek it in vain, it does not exist, onlythe Collectivity itself exists, nothing more, the concentration of people, mass, acreature arisen from the masses, an expressive mass. I sat over a beer across fromthat student, fetchingly young and so vulnerable, yet so dangerous. I looked at hishead and his hand. His head! His hand!A hand ready to kill in the name of childhood. The extension of theabsurdity, imagined by him, was a bloody bayonet. . . . A strange being—with amuddled and frivolous head, with a dangerous hand. The thought occurred to me,a thought neither clear nor complete, which I nevertheless desire to note here. . . .It would sound more or less like this: his head is full of chimeras, therefore it isworthy of indulgence, but his hand has the gift of transforming chimeras into478Volume 2reality; it is capable of creating facts. Unreality from the head, reality from thehand . . . and the seriousness from one end. . . .Perhaps I am grateful to him that he returned my old anxieties to me. Theself-assurance of a member of the intelligentsia, intellectual, artist, which grows inme with age, is bad! Remember, those who do not write in ink, write in blood.

They do not know that I am somewhat of a specialist in their main problem—immaturity—and that all of my literature is at home in it. It is paradoxical that inSouth America, Borges, abstract, exotic, not tied to their problems, is a luminary,but I have only a handful of readers. The paradox, which stops being a paradoxwhen one reﬂects that they can show Borges off in Europe. Not me because I am aPole. I am not valor nacional.That they do not want to be the darling pupils of alien cultures, I feel isright. And I also agree that they have their own reality and that only in supportingthemselves on it can they become someone in the world. . . . But, in my opinion,they commit one serious, dramatic error. . . .Namely, instead of saying ‘‘I,’’ they say ‘‘we.’’ We Americans. We Argen-tineans. When a single man says ‘‘we,’’ he is misusing the word, for no one hasauthorized him to use it, he is allowed to speak only in his own voice. Who-ever wants to get at his ‘‘own reality’’ and support himself on it should avoid theplural form at all costs. What is this ‘‘our reality’’? I can be certain only of ‘‘myreality.’’ What is America, Americans? A concept, generality, abstraction. What isthe ‘‘American reality’’? Something that each person can understand as he wishes.The difference between them and me comes down to their wanting to ﬁrstdiscover American reality and liberate America from European dependence andonly later to produce this new type of ‘‘mature’’ American. This new America,discovered and deﬁned, will create its people. In my view, one must begin withman, the individual man, and I will say more: the development of America canonly be the work of people who have overcome America in themselves.You say that your America is backward, immature? Good. But in that caseyour ﬁrst task should be to liberate yourself from its inhibiting inﬂuence. As a man,you are just as good as an Englishman or a Frenchman. As a Cuban or a Paraguayan,1960479you are worse. Feel yourself a man, then place yourself above this undevelopedAmerica. Do not allow your milieu and your American way of thinking to shackle you.Except that . . . this immaturity imposes the word ‘‘we’’ on them. They arein a collective phase and this phase is also South America’s so they cannot maketheir way out of it. ‘‘I’’ is too independent for them, too free. They are ‘‘we.’’ Theyare America. And in being America, how can they progress? They have gottenbogged down together with it in history. Amen.Much of this could be applied to Poland and Poles.
Tuesday
On the ship General Artigas on the way to Montevideo. Night. Storm. Apriest reads the paper. A child cries. Waiters talk in the corner. The boat creaks.The melody from Brahms’s Fourth Symphony, which has been doggingme from the time I left Buenos Aires. I think about Brahms’s themes and Beetho-ven’s themes. Beethoven makes a strange impression against the background ofBrahms’s constant threat that the work will not be organic enough—Brahms’sthematics, cautious and deliberate, are permeated by a concern for the homogene-ity of composition; you can see that this architect is afraid his building mightcollapse. But Beethoven loaded themes suggested by his spirit into a work with thecertainty that whatever is conceived of the spirit cannot be stillborn. And thistearing of Beethoven’s theme into a work, as if from the outside, only to sink itsroots into it, seems to be somehow singular, singularly bold, captivating, when Irecall how Brahms builds up gradually, cautiously from himself and never, so tospeak, does he stick his nose beyond himself.How the wind batters the canvas on the deck! Fatigue. Why does thisentrancing melody—the second theme from the allegro of the third concerto—come to mind exactly at this moment? Ravishing.Why—I would like to know—in musical analyses, in learned commentary,does one avoid mentioning the beauty and charm of such melodies? There is nodoubt that when we are still in the beginning phase of listening to the work theoverwhelmingly melodious entrance of the orchestra and piano are what theyshould be: the dominant effect, the most important, most thrilling effect. It is only ina gradual acquaintance with the work that one exhausts their charm; other more480Volume 2complex values then attract our attention. This is why experts are silent about theirﬁrst impressions. Is it right, though, that a work be judged by an ear that has becomeweary and is incapable of experiencing the holiness of its ﬁrst emotions?The lights ﬂicker. The front wall of the salon rides from the bottom upand from the top down. The ship is blown through and through by the whistlingwind. In Pornograﬁa I tried to return to such melodies . . . melodic, thrilling . . .alluring. . . .And not only in Pornograﬁa. But in Pornograﬁa I was able to get up mycourage and I resigned from humor, which isolates.A waiter brings black coffee. Something knocks against the wall, as if tryingto get to my head. What impertinence on my part—to ﬂee to such thrilling-melodic subjects! And today, when modern music is afraid of melody, when thecomposer, before he uses it, must clear it of attractions, render it dry. It is nodifferent in literature—a modern but self-respecting writer avoids lures, is difﬁcult,and prefers to repulse rather than tempt. And me? I am exactly the opposite, I loadthe text with tasty tastes, charming charms, I stuff it with excitement and colors, Ido not want dry, unprepossessing writing . . . I am seeking the most graspablemelodies . . . in order to get at, if possible, something even more ‘‘captivating.’’ . . .Siren. I go on deck. The ship is moaning painfully, it plunges into theexploding water under the dome of a full moon wracked on the surface. God!What pain! What despair! In my heavy, painful striving to rejuvenate, to freshenmy art, I have not even refrained from, ah, let us confess . . . boy with girl. Oh,shame! Who in today’s literature is bolder? This is my boldness! The river-oceanroars. But, but . . . let us confess on this thundering trail of water, white with fury,unloading its despair under a quiet moon. . . . I, accursed one, could approachtheir nakedness only in a costume more sophisticated than that worn by the mostmodern avant-garde, by the driest intellect! I made them parenthetical!I made them parenthetical; I couldn’t sing any other way!
Wednesday, Montevideo
I stroll in a tidy city, with odd balconies and congenial people. Montevideo.Here the old decorum still reigns after having been expelled from many other partsof South America.1960481Kind faces, rich apparel, a beach twenty minutes away by bus, this is thelife! And if I moved here permanently?Avenidas running into the ocean-river.The world is written for two voices. Youth supplements the Incompletewith Completion—and this is its brilliant task. This is the subject of Pornograﬁa.One of my chief aesthetic and spiritual tasks: to ﬁnd an approach to youththat is sharper and more dramatic than that which is currently in use. To thrust itinto maturity (that is, to reveal its ties with maturity).
Thursday
Peace. Anxiety! I am a little disturbed by the complete lack of a ‘‘metaphysi-cal spine tingle’’ in the Uruguayan capital, where no dog has ever bitten anyone.Pornograﬁa. Pulling two older men down . . . into the body, senses, thejuvenile . . . when I was writing this, I felt vague. But I needed ‘‘physics,’’ it wasindispensable as a counterweight to metaphysics. And the reverse—metaphysicscried out for the body. I do not believe in a nonerotic philosophy. I do not trustthought that frees itself of sex. . . .Of course it is difﬁcult to imagine Hegel’s Logic without abandoning thebody. But pure consciousness must once again be immersed in the body, in sex, inEros, the artist must again thrust the philosopher into beauty. Consciousnessdictates the conviction that it is ﬁnal, and its work would surely be impossiblewithout this certainty—but the results of its work can be returned to life, conceivedfrom a different position, by another spirit, here the spirit of art can be of use tothe spirit of the thinker. And even if an incurable contradiction between themdoes exist—are we not a walking contradiction, are we not forced to live thedivision we are?That peculiar absolute of sex, the erotic absolute. This divided world of thesexual drive which, because of its division, becomes self-sufﬁcient, absolute! Whatother absolute is needed when he who desires has drowned in the eyes of shewho desires?Sun. Breakfast with Minister Mazurkiewicz and with the long-time honor-ary consul in Montevideo, Józef Makowski, who plays host. We fondly rememberStraszewicz and other friends.482Volume 2Friday
Foul weather rants and raves in all directions. We sit at the Tip Top, Dipiand I, and we drink coffee, staring at the dirty waves under the rain. I look at thepaper. Ah, in the evening at the Writers’ Union Dickman, who is visiting fromArgentina, is supposed to read a paper at a session chaired by an old acquaintance,the Uruguayan poet Paulina Medeiros. We will attend—I not so much to hearDickman but to see Paulina.It ended dramatically (all of my contacts with the escritores of this conti-nent end dramatically).We appear midway through the lecture. Dickman is talking about twenty-ﬁve years of work as a writer. Uruguayan literati—not one interesting face—anduniversal courtesy, banality, and boredom hang in the air. I feel that the sight of thismob of writers is beginning to excite me—as always. I am allergic to writers ingroups, in their mob aspect; when I look at my ‘‘colleagues’’ all together I get sick.But I don’t know if this will be clear, the sound of the word escritor in SouthAmerica is somehow dumber than anywhere else; here the writing profession ﬂoatsin some sort of special, pompously ﬁctional sauce, highmindedly sincere, rancidand honeycombed. And this ridiculousness, rising like steam from the escritores,amuses me. Applause. He is ﬁnished.Paulina Medeiros rises and announces that by happenstance the Unionalso has a foreign guest, the writer Gombrowicz, whom we greet, etc., etc.—andnow perhaps Mr. Gombrowicz would like to say a few words? . . . Silence. Expecta-tion. I admit that I really did act inappropriately. Instead of saying a few pleasantwords, that I greet them, etc., etc., I say to Paulina:—That’s all well and good,Paulina, but what have I written? What are the titles of my books?A lethal question, for no one in America knows anything about me. Con-sternation. Paulina’s stammering and blushing, for she’s completely taken aback.Dickman comes to her aid: —I know! Gombrowicz published a novel in BuenosAires, a translation from the, uh, Rumanian, no, from Polish, uh, Fitmurca . . . no,Fidafurca. . . . I sit in cold sadism, I sit and say nothing; people begin to stir and toleave their seats in embarrassment, when ﬁnally the chairman, or the secretary,carries in an enormous book into which Dickman inscribes an appropriate apho-rism and I my signature—after which I pass the tome to Dipi so that he can sign it1960483too. Which again sends a ripple of anxiety through the respectful crowd, becauseDipi is of draft age and doesn’t look like a writer at all. He signs his name with aﬂourish—his signature is probably the most commanding in the whole book—andI explain that he has been writing novels since the age of fourteen and already hasfour to his credit.
Saturday
Straight from the unfortunate visit to the Writers’ Union—I am speaking ofmy stay in Montevideo—we, Paulina Medeiros, Dickman, Dipi, and I, went to apeña of poets. This took place in a tiny, pretentious restaurant, where a wallpainting added wings to a menu deprived of all imagination. At an enormous tablesat about ﬁfty people. Paulina explains quietly: this is a banquet given by the poetsin honor of Professor R., this will introduce us to the poetic climate of the capital.Who is this Professor R.?—Oh!—a worthy gentleman—a renowned critic—univer-sity professor—author—friend, father, guardian of poets—who has just received anaward for a collection of essays and hence the feast.Never would I have assumed . . . no, I still do not know America, I do notknow it in all of its complexity, its strange mixture of levels, its half-baked qual-ity. . . . What I saw, so terribly provincial, would not have been possible in the worstArgentine backwater, but, at the same time, to my delight, was straight out of thePickwick Club.A luxuriant angelicism reigned. Next to the angel Professor R., who smiled,greeted, and charmed, sat another angel, a frisky and ardently poetic old man, sopoetic he ran the session, warming and buoying everyone’s spirits. Speeches, a poetstands up and lets out a poem in honor of Professor R. Applause.Right after that a poetiza rises and dashes off a poem in honor of theprofessor. Applause.Then yet another poet rises and lets ﬂy a poem in honor of the professor.Praise. Applause. It was only then that I realized a strange, uncommon thing not somuch out of Dickens but Chesterton: even if there were ﬁfty of them, all of themwere poets and each would launch a poem in Professor R.’s honor (who discreetlyand tactfully let it be understood that it was not he who mattered but the poetry).I called the waiter to bring me two bottles of wine, one white, the other red,484Volume 2and I began to drain them both! Meanwhile poets were declaiming, R. beamed,angelicism glowed along with all of the virtues practiced in such cases—humility,discretion, but also gentility, emotion, heart, as if it had all been taken out of thesweetest and most poetic dreams of some old maiden aunt: ‘‘beautiful’’ and ‘‘pure.’’When the poet ﬁnished, people shook his hand and everyone yelled ‘‘bravo!’’When, in conclusion, this fat hussy impatiently awaiting her turn tore from herseat and, tossing her bust left and right and waving her arms, trundled out morebouquets of rhymed gentility, I, full of the red and white, couldn’t stand it anylonger and burst out laughing, stiﬂing my spasms in Dipi’s back. He also broke upbut had no back to bury his face in and so exploded with laughter right in front ofthe entire gathering!Shock. Looks. But here stands the honorable laureate and utters: that hewasn’t deserving, although maybe he was, but no he wasn’t, although maybe hewas. . . . People are moved. Applause. The angel-chairman-poet thanks all presentand warms their hearts. . . . The atmosphere becomes so rariﬁed and sweet thatDipi and I dash for the nearest door, stumbling, drunk as skunks, soused, andmighty plastered.Had I once again compromised Poles in front of foreigners? Give me more,‘‘this is what I like,’’ as Mickiewicz would say! But this is not the point. Some-thing else interests me here. How would these events look from the other, Uru-guayan side?‘‘Indifferent, conceited, and stuck-up European writer demonstrates con-tempt for the naive, perhaps, but heartfelt freshness of Uruguayan poetry!’’Meanwhile—it was exactly the opposite. I was freshness, sincerity amongthem and they—what can one say—were a gang of dealers, fabricating an artiﬁcialatmosphere of mutual adoration.This kind of quiproquo: a provincial young poet is no innocent . . . while anold cynic ﬁghts for the purity of poetry naively, purely.
Saturday
Gossip in action! While eating supper the next day at the Tip Top, Dipioverheard a conversation at a nearby table about the scandal at the Writers’ Unionand the provocation at the poet’s banquet . . . and somebody suggested that they1960485write to Ernesto Sabato to ask him if his letter of recommendation to Julio Baycewas authentic!
Saturday
A cocktail in Carrasco. I can’t stand this comfortable bourgeoisie with itsaire acondicionado, electric heating, two bathrooms for the servants, and a view ofthe ocean.Michelangelo’s David is lending luster to the town hall. A sudden, movinginvasion of the Renaissance—a feeling, some sort of shortcut, of the countlessdelights contained in style in general, and in this style in particular, so happilyrediscovered after so many centuries! A conversation with Asnito (Dipi) on thesubject of the Renaissance—the Baroque— Cézanne—concrete art. I am amazedat the ﬂuency with which this young nestling swims in today’s complicated eddies.A letter from a certain writer.
‘‘A few days ago I ﬁnished reading Pornograﬁa. Kultura ’s announcement of it, done with your permission I am sure, speaks of the metaphysical substance ofthis book. . . . Until now, it seemed to me that I have always managed todecipher the hidden meanings beneath the surface of your works, but in Por-nograﬁa, for the ﬁrst time, I was incapable of getting at its hidden sense. That iswhy I am allowing myself to turn directly to you for help, with a plea for anindication of where I am to seek the metaphysical content of Pornograﬁa.’’
But of course! This letter comes at a good time. It allows me to rememberonce again who I am and what my position on the spiritual-artistic map is.I answer:
‘‘I had nothing to do with composing the announcement in Kultura, but I willmost gladly tell you what, according to me, are  Pornograﬁa’s ties to meta- physics.‘‘Let us try to express it another way: man, as we know, strives for theAbsolute, for Completeness. For absolute truth, God, complete maturity, etc. Toembrace everything, to fully realize the process of his development—such is theimperative.‘‘Thus, in Pornograﬁa (in keeping with my old habit, because Ferdy-486Volume 2durke is also saturated with this) another, probably more hidden and lesslegitimate, aim of man is revealed, his need for the Incomplete . . . Imper-fection . . . Inferiority . . . Youth. . . .‘‘One of the key scenes of the work is the one in the church where underthe pressure of Frederick’s consciousness the Mass, together with God-the-Absolute, collapses. Then out of the darkness and emptiness of the cosmoscomes a new divinity, earthly, sensual, underage, made up of two underdevel-oped beings creating a closed world—because they attract one another.‘‘Another key scene is the deliberations preceding Siemian’s murder—the Adults are not in a state to commit murder because they know all too wellwhat it is, what weight it has, and they must do it with the hands of minors. Thismurder must, therefore, be cast into a sphere of lightness, irresponsibility—onlythere does it become possible.‘‘I am not just writing about this now, these ideas permeate all my work.And in the Diary I mention, for instance, that ‘Youth . . . appeared to me as theonly, highest, and absolute value of life. . . . That ‘‘value,’’ however, had onecharacteristic, probably devised by the devil himself, that, being youth, it wasalways something beneath value.’‘‘These last words (‘beneath value’) explain why, in spite of the sharpconﬂict in life-consciousness in me, I did not end up in any of the modernexistentialisms. The authenticity and inauthenticity of life are equally preciousto me—my antinomy is Value on the one hand and Not-Quite-Value on theother . . . Dissatisfaction . . . Underdevelopment. . . . This is, I think, the mostimportant thing in me, the most personal and individual. A lack of seriousnessis just as important to man as seriousness. If a philospher says that ‘Man wantsto be God,’ then I would add: ‘Man wants to be young.’‘‘And according to me, the various periods of human age are one of thetools of this dialectic Completion-Incompletion, Value-Nonvalue. That is why Iattribute a signiﬁcant and dramatic role to the introductory age—youth. Andthat is why my world is degraded: it is like grabbing the Spirit by the scruff of theneck and immersing it in lightness, in inferiority. . . .‘‘Of course, in Pornograﬁa I am not so much seeking philosphicaltheses as desiring to extract the artistic and psychological possibilities of thesubject. I am looking for ‘beauties’ appropriate to the conﬂict. Is Pornograﬁametaphysical/ Metaphysics means beyond-physics, beyond-corporeality, and1960487my intention was to get at certain antinomies of the soul through the body.‘‘This work is probably very difﬁcult, although it has the appearance ofan ordinary ‘novel’ and even a pretty indecent one at that. . . . I am impatientlyawaiting its appearance in French, German, and Italian—these editions areslowly in the making—I hope that I will ﬁnd more readers, like you, seeking itsmeaning on foreign soil.’’
Sunday
Malvin, the beach beyond Carrasco, an oceanic revelation, the suddensalt, greenness of the waves, astonishment, admiration, regret—the wreckage be-hind me of an enormous river, its annihilation in splashing, salty, green inﬁnity,whose whisper expresses nothing.Perhaps I am more yoked to the nation than it seems? Again this suspicion.And if Pornograﬁa is an attempt to revive Polish eroticism? An attempt to recover an eroticism more appropriate to our fate and ourhistory of recent years, which consists of rape, slavery, humiliation, dog ﬁghts, adescent into the dark extremes of the consciousness and the body? And perhapsPornograﬁa is a modern Polish, erotic, national poem?A rather unexpected and strange idea—it never occurred to me while I waswriting it. Only now. I do not write for the nation or with the nation or from thenation. I write with myself, from myself. But isn’t my thicket joined in secretpassage with the thicket of the nation?I, an American, I, an Argentinean, walking the coast of the Atlantic . . . I amstill a Pole . . . yes . . . but just from my youth, childhood, from the awful forceswhich formed me then, pregnant with what was to follow. . . . There, beyondMalvin, the proud insolence of land conjured up by the setting sun, like the mostnoble philosophy and the most splendid poetry. Downward! Downward! Degrada-tion! I am my own degradation! How mercilessly man has to cast himself from thepeaks—foul his own nobility—violate his own truth—destroy his own dignity—forhis individual spirit to undergo slavery once again and submit to the herd, to thespecies. . . .4881961

Monday
A very peculiar book, I have never read anything like it, exciting in astrange way, Gaëtan Picon’s Panorama des idées contemporaines. In Polish transla-tion, Picon’s work is called A Panorama of Modern Thought and has been pub-lished by Libella in Paris.It has been a long time since I dove into a book with the enthusiasm I felt inreading these seven hundred pages, stuffed with the latest wisdom from recentdecades. Philosophy and social science, art and religion, physics and mathematics,history and psychology, but also the history of philosophy and political problemsand contemporary humanism . . . the volume encompasses various branches ofscience, not by giving a dry summary, however, but by presenting excerpts from themost representative works. This is the kind of anthology where the history ofphilosophy is reported by the selected texts of Dilthey, Lenin, Trotsky, Jaurès,Berdyayev, Spengler, Toynbee, Croce, Aron, Jaspers, and on quantum theory andassociated problems by Broglie, Bohr, Einstein. One should not seek exhaustivediscussion here—but rather an introduction to the style of today’s science, its tone,temperament, ‘‘character’’ (because sometimes I have the impression that scienceis a person), and customs! It is as if you were listening to a meeting where ﬁrst onethen another sage expresses himself; what an opportunity to listen closely to theirmanner of speaking. . . .1961489Wednesday
Buenos Aires. An interview with me in Clarín —Pat Leroy (Zdzis™aw Bau) conducted it. Clarín is the most popular daily in Argentina; the two-page interviewwith a huge photograph of me and a drawing by Quilomboﬂora—will surely causea stir. I said (among other things) that ‘‘not being a premier Shorthorn bull, I couldnot aspire to fame in Buenos Aires.’’
Thursday
And what if Cassandra appeared to Socrates in a dream with this prophecy:
—O mortal ones! O human race! It would be better for you not to reach thedistant future, which will be diligent, scrupulous, forced, slick, shallow, miser-able. . . . Let women cease bearing children—for everything will be born to youinside out, greatness will give birth to pettiness, power to weakness, and yourstupidity will be born of reason. Oh, better that women should strangle theirnewborn! . . . because you will have functionaries for leaders and heroes, anddecent little souls will be your Titans. You will be deprived of beauty, passion,and delight . . . a cold, tired, and barren time awaits you. And all of this will beperpetrated upon you by your Wisdom, which will break away from you andbecome impossible to comprehend as well as rapacious. And you will not evenbe able to cry because your misfortune will happen beyond you!
Is this blasphemy against the Almighty Lord? Against today’s creator? (I amspeaking of science, of course.) Who would dare! Even I am prostrated before theyoungest of Creative Forces—and I humble myself, hosanna; the above prophecyhails the triumph of almighty Minerva over her enemy, man. Let us take a closerlook at these people of the future, these people of science—and today there is nolack of them, they are spreading fast. One thing is repulsive in this scientist: hissmiling impotence, his genial helplessness. He is similar to a pipe that funnels foodbut does not digest it, so that knowledge never becomes personal in him; he issimply a tool, an instrument from head to foot. One talks to this kind of professorthe way one would to a ﬁsh out of water; each of them dies if taken out of his specialarea—this is shameful, one should burn with embarrassment! Modest? In theirplace, I would also be modest, why not? Nothing they do enters the bloodstream.490Volume 2Accursed blind chickens who happen upon a kernel! Blind masons laying brickupon brick, ignorant of what they are building! They are workers. They are co-workers. If one says A, the other says B, and the third C, and so the prevailingopinion is formed: each is a function of each, each uses the other, all are alwaysservants—sucked dry by the vampire of the intellect, pushed down by the more andmore inaccessible Thought rising above them.Even in my youth people laughed at the professor, an abstract old grand-dad, chasing his hat. Today no one laughs anymore, we are beginning to shrink,curl up, we begin to feel a little strange when we see how this kindly band ofspecialists tries to get at our hides, rearrange our genes, creep into our dreams,transform our cosmos, stick a needle into our central nervous system, feel our mostintimate inner organs, which should not be touched! This brazen and vile uncer-emoniousness, this nasty thing that is beginning to happen to us does not horrify usenough—but shortly we will begin to howl, we will see how this friend and bene-factress, Science, as it is more and more unleashed, becomes a bull that takes us onits horns, an element more volatile than anything we have had to deal with up tonow. The growing light will be transformed into darkness and we will ﬁnd our-selves in a new night, the worst one yet.Professors love their wives. They are good fathers. Their attachment to thehearth is cozy and begs for forgiveness, since they know well that they never feel athome in their homes. They speak no language. A scientist betrays ordinary humanspeech for scientiﬁc language, but he does not wield this either—the tongue wieldshim, not the other way around. Formulas form themselves in this closed Land ofAbracadabra. As long as a mechanistic interpretation of phenomena held up,things weren’t too bad—but today when the mechanism no longer satisﬁes and wereach for a ‘‘whole’’ that does not lend itself to division into parts, when functional-ism, ﬁnalism, and various coordinates fascinate scientiﬁc thought, the statementsof biology or psychology are sphinxlike, headlong, no better than physical, mathe-matical, or philosophical statements. Picon’s anthology, mentioned above, is an excellent demonstration of thescientiﬁc style in various guises, in a thousand variations; here one sees howthis language is created and what it does with these people. One sees clearlyhow expression becomes convulsive and goes crazy from the desire to grasp whatis ungraspable. This is quite a circus. And how could the language of a ratio-1961491nalized international wisdom that is constantly growing from generation to gen-eration and turning against the very nature of the individual mind in order todo it violence be otherwise? The pressure to utter the inexpressible becomesso overwhelming in the ﬁnal phases of the development of science that its state-ments become related to philosophy. Translating the texts selected by Picon musthave been pure torture; the translator must do ugly things with words here, it isunavoidable.The hideous strangeness of knowledge . . . it is like an alien body intro-duced into the mind, it always obstructs. One bears this kind of thinking like aweight, in the sweat of one’s brow; science often acts like poison; the weaker themind, the fewer antidotes it ﬁnds and the more easily it succumbs. Take a look atthe majority of students. Where, for instance, does their lack of joy come from? Istheir fatigue merely a consequence of excessive work? Weren’t their reactionspoisoned by the habit of false precision, an exaggerated objectivity, did this not casttheir judgments into uncertainty, fear? Let us see how the cult of logic kills under-standing of the personality, how principles replace an inborn self-assurance andthe certainty of one’s own convictions, how theories extirpate grace and beauty . . .this is where the new type of student comes from (‘‘Hey, pal, are you passing?’’), adecent, upright, useful, but wan being . . . with a lunar pallor drained of allbrilliance and heat, reﬂecting only that awful, incomprehensible light. Perhapsstill alive but only as a weakened, twisted form of life.Is this the introduction to a race of pigmies with swollen heads and whitelab coats?
Friday
Degeneration awaits us so we should brace ourselves for it today. I do notdeny that someday science may lead us to paradise. Until that day, however, weare threatened by a series of operations, deforming, almost surgical interventions(which is what happens to patients who are subjected to only three introductoryoperations in a series of twelve that are supposed to improve their faces).The transformation of the conditions of our lives, as well as of our psycho-physical structure, with the help of technology, will knock us out of our groove andunsettle us.492Volume 2Friday
Science muddles.Science reduces.Science disﬁgures.Science warps.Will scientism replace art? Oh, I am not at all afraid of losing admirers!I do not fear that ‘‘future generations will not read novels,’’ etc. It is proba-bly a complete misunderstanding to conceive of serious art in categories of produc-tion, market, readers, supply and demand—what does this have to do with any-thing?—art is not the fabrication of stories for readers but a spiritual cohabitation,something so tense and so separate from science, even contradictory to it, thatthere can be no competition between them. If someone ﬁne, digniﬁed, proliﬁc,brilliant (this is how one ought to speak of artists, this is the language art demands)is born in the future, if someone unique and unrepeatable is born, a Bach, aRembrandt, then he will win people over, charm and seduce them. . . . As long as superior and inferior people exist, a superior man, expressinghimself in art, will be attractive . . . and nothing will weaken his existence.You talk about engineers, technocrats, and other functionaries’ indiffer-ence to art? Was a dialogue between an artist and a cog on a wheel ever possible?Yet everyday I realize how eager for the glow of artistry is a person who has beendrawn into a rut yet has maintained enough humanity to feel that his back is beingbroken.When a student of the sciences sits down at my table to look at me conde-scendingly (as I ‘‘shoot the breeze’’), to scorn me (because this is ‘‘putting peopleon’’), to yawn (because ‘‘one cannot prove this with an experiment’’), I don’t try toconvince him. I wait until a wave of weariness and satiety overtakes him. For it istrue that in science there is less putting people on, less claptrap, and less of the‘‘personal dirt’’ that infests art—ambitions, striving for effect, posing, affection,rhetoric—but it is also true that science gives these guarantees only because it func-tions in a very limited territory—and this laboratory ‘‘certainty’’ becomes odiousand humiliating to a nature not entirely mediocre.Average intelligence loves blinders, which facilitate an even trot; but abrisker and livelier intelligence desires uncertainty, risk, a play of more deceptive1961493and elusive forces, where one lives . . . where one can preserve ﬂight, pride, joke,confession, rapture, play, struggle.A moment arrives when theory becomes a personal enemy; one desiresman, one desires him, however he may be, vague, untruthful, unascertainable . . .just to see humanity and touch it again.
Sunday
Publishing books at a distance of ten thousand kilometers ruins the nerves!Ferdydurke appeared in Germany without commentary to explain brieﬂy‘‘what it is about’’—thus some critics and readers did not know where to begin. I im-mediately wrote to the English publisher to have him add a brief explanation to thepreface.All for naught! The English Ferdydurke also appeared without the fewsentences it needed so badly.Let it appear, as it wants, I have to leave it all to God’s mercy and shut myeyes. Let it happen by itself!
Tuesday
When will we take the offensive?Will we, artists, ﬁnally be able to attack the man of science in the name of amore radiant humanity? To attack—from what position? With what means? Are wein a position to attack at all? In past decades art has acted badly—it allowed itself tobe appealed to, it almost fell to its knees, it received everything greedily fromthe hand of its enemy, it lacked pride and even an ordinary instinct for self-preservation. The results?Painting overrun by abstraction and other concepts of form—all inspiredby science—there is in this art a greater and greater diminishing of individuality,superiority, talent, the work is more and more ‘‘democratic’’ and ‘‘objective.’’Music corrupted by theory, technique, followed by a breakdown of thepersonality and the violent shrinking of composers so that soon no one will knowwhat to call these dwarfs.And belles lettres, whose beauty kills itself more each year and which has494Volume 2become evil and brutal, almost rabid—or nauseous—or dry and stiff—analytical,sociological, phenomenological, laborious, boring, and off the mark.What sort of attack can this kind of art dream of if it cannot even defenditself and is already half-conquered? Theories could not have achieved this if theartist had not personally—again I return to this key word—suffered a breakdownand had not allowed his separateness to be weakened.The individual is a nut so impossible to crack that no theoretic tooth will beable to manage it. And so nothing will be able to justify your defeat, bumblers!
Thursday
A letter from Maria D˛ abrowska—so typical that I wonder if I should discussit in the diary.I decided to write the preface to the French edition of Pornograﬁa myself.Quequén.Santiago Achaval, Juan Santamarina, Paco Virasoro, and Pepe Uniburu—wealthy young people from the oligarchy. How many brothers and sisters do theyhave? Paco has the least—a mere six. Forty-plus siblings altogether for the fourof them.Niaki Zuberbuhler has eighty ﬁrst cousins. Rural reform is being carriedout in bed.The false erudition of the literati is also the result of their being depraved byscience. How easy it is to arm oneself with a few encyclopedias and shine withquotations, everyone does that, from columnists to Nobel laureates! And what’smore, it was always this way. But we live in an era that is unmasking us—whydoesn’t someone speak openly about the misery of quotations?A taboo subject! Anything but this! It might turn out that the staunchestseekers of truth and strivers for ruthless honesty pretend to be more educated thanthey are. What a lack of dignity. . . .1961495Saturday
I expect that in years to come art will have to shake off science and turnagainst it—this clash will take place sooner or later. Then there will be an openbattle, with each side completely aware of its cause.Meanwhile we have lots of camouﬂage, ruses, betrayal; even a ﬁfth columnis not lacking. The ﬁfth column in art territory is existentialism and phenomenology.It might appear that existentialism wants to help art—but this very strangecourtesan, who betrays everything with everything, can only compromise the per-son who socializes with her. This neither ﬁsh nor fowl cannot aspire to form at all—what then can it have in common with art?Yet it is so tantalizing! It is so full of promises! In it dwells a concentratedand incorruptible (it seems) striving for the concrete, for the personality. . . . Sowhat if this antiabstraction cannot sustain itself in any kind of philosophical think-ing in which a conceptual schema is inevitable. In fact, existentialism becomes atrap: this antirational pork fat is supposed to entice the gullible into just one moreconceptual cage.Each spiritual stance creates its own style. But existentialism, conceived ofnothing but contradictions and incapable of reconciling them à la Hegel (becausedialectics fails here), does not lead to just any style but to one of the worst styles,obscurely precise, abstractly concrete, subjectively objective, to empty talk thatsplits its seams. One would swear upon seeing these thinkers that they want todance sitting down—that is how pedantic and volatile existentialism is.I prefer phenomenology; it is purer from the standpoint of form. Onecould even nurture the hope that it is a means of purging the waste of scientism;well, well, isn’t this a return to a natural, direct thinking, immaculately virgin? Putscience outside the pale! That’s what we need to do!Existentialism is a mirage! A ruse! If it can’t stand science, then it is like adaughter who cannot stand her natural mother—Cartesian, conceived in a scien-tiﬁc spirit, passionless, cold, like ice—and her cadaver coldness is of no use tous at all.496Volume 2Monday
Bondy, the editor of Preuves, appeared in Buenos Aires preceded by a ring-ing of bells in the press. After reading these articles I was certain that at the air-port there would be a group of dignitaries with the French ambassador at theirhead and that Bondy would be torn to pieces, at least like Barrault; I decided,therefore, to behave discreetly and did not appear at the hotel—which, having inmind the category of guest, could only be the Plaza or Alvear—until the follow-ing day.Meanwhile, when I returned home that day, Frau Schultze told me that acertain man had been asking for me and that he had left his name and address. Iread: François Bondy, City Hotel. I go to the City, a few blocks from me. We greeteach other cordially. I explain why I did not appear sooner, that I did not want totake his time.—Why? I had breakfast at Victoria Ocampo’s but now I am free. Let’s talk!We go to the café and gab, gab. Evening. Once more I cautiously ﬁsh formention of dinner at the ambassador’s, the Academy of Literature, the JockeyClub. . . . No, speaking frankly, he has nothing to do and doesn’t know where to go.I had been invited to Zosia Ch˛adzy ´nska’s house for supper that evening and notthinking much about it, I took him along. Zosia, a worldly person, did not betraysurprise when he appeared behind me. I said: —Bondy! They greet each other as ifeverything were normal. The architect Zamecznik is visiting from Poland, I callthe Lubomirskis and ask them to come over, we organize a small supper (very mod-est, as always at Zosia’s, but the French bubbles like champagne . . .), yet some-thing unsaid hangs in the air.On our departure the ladies wink at me: —Confess, who did you bring?Who is this? A poet? Italian, or what? Where’d you get him? They thought I was putting them on! This important editor, whom it isdifﬁcult to imagine without four phones and three secretaries, is very much thepoet. He is a poet so much that sometimes we, poets, harbor the suspicion that hisindolence, his expression of a lost child, greedy eyes, the strange capacity for justappearing (instead of walking in normally), are to lure us and use us coldly to hisown purposes. But I cheer myself that politicians are inclined to do the reverse, tonurture the fear that Bondy’s cold organizational talents are to dupe them and to1961497catch them in nets of poetry. Bondy probably (I know him very little) is one of thosepeople whose strength lies in his absence; he is always removed from what he isdoing, keeping at least one foot somewhere else, his wisdom is the wisdom of a calfthat suckles two mothers.

How should one mobilize against science? From what positions shouldone strike? To ﬁnd a point of support in order to rouse contempt from its positions,the possibility of contempt. . . . And this terrifying perspective of a greater andgreater division into Homo sapiens and . . . and . . . and into what? Into somethingthat will reveal itself in a future art.

In Fragata.I asked them: —What should an ordinary man do when he meets a learnedman? And when a scientist surrounds him with his concentrated knowledge—hisbesserwisser? How should he go about defending himself?They did not know. I explained to them that the most appropriate counter-argument would be a blow with foot or ﬁst to the very person of the specialist.And I added that this is called in my terminology ‘‘paring a person down tosize,’’ or ’’reducing someone to a person.’’ At any rate, it drives one straight out oftheory. . . .And I asked, could you, O artist, deliver a punch or kick to the professor?An indecent question. Yes, but a crucial one.You are perhaps of the opinion that art and science ought to run forwardtogether, passing the torch from hand to hand, like a marathon? Leave this runningto the athletes. The future looks unkind and even pitiless. Cooperation between artand science in the name of progress would be refreshing but a poet should knowthat the professor will strangle him in that tender embrace. Science is a rogue. Letus not believe in the humanity of science, for man does not steer it, it rides him! If498Volume 2you are interested in how the scientiﬁc ‘‘humanity of man’’ will look in the future,take a look at a few doctors. Their ‘‘goodness,’’ their ‘‘humanity’’? Yes, but whatsort of humanity? A bit strange, isn’t it? Yes, good but not really good, humanbut inhuman . . . what a guardian angel, dry and cold as a devil, an angel-technocrat. The hospital doesn’t ruin his breakfast. Infernal coldness and unbeliev-able indifference.Unbelievable—I emphasize this because all of the changes in our natureinﬂuenced by science bear the mark of the fantastic, as if they happened outsidethe normal course of development. We are at the threshold of a bizarre humanity.Reason will perform surgery on us that is unpredictable. It must go forward all thetime, its syllogisms never retreat—they do not return to where they began.It might perhaps appear to someone of rosy disposition that if science tearsus away from our humanity, it is only to return us to it . . . that someday thedegeneration dealt by reason will lead back to human nature . . . to a nobler,healthier man . . . and that at the end of this painful road we will ﬁnd each other.No! We will never recover anything again! We will never return to any-thing! In giving ourselves up to reason, we must bid farewell to ourselves for alleternity—it never turns back the clock! The man of the future, a creation ofscience, will be radically different, incomprehensible, unrelated to us. This is whyscientiﬁc development means death. . . . One dies just as one is . . . for the sake ofsome stranger. Man, led by science, throws himself away—in his present form—once and for all. Don’t you understand? By this I simply mean that if the man ofthe future has a second head growing out of his butt, they will ﬁnd this kind ofthing neither funny nor repulsive.And art? What does it have to say about this, the art that is so in love withtoday’s human form, so cuddled up to our person? There is nothing more personal,private, unique, or our own than art—the Brandenburg Concertos, the portrait ofCharles V, Les ﬂeurs du mal, if they have become common property it is onlybecause the unique and unrepeatable character of the creator was imprinted uponthem, like a seal claiming that it belongs to me, this is my work, this is I!If, therefore, as I have said, nothing plants you as ﬁrmly in your personalityas a ﬁst or a kick—when, O art, will you stop being docile and begin to punch?1961499Monday
I am not a brute. I am not looking for a street ﬁght. Nor am I ranting,scaring, exaggerating in demagogic ﬂight—no, I am not exaggerating—I have al-ways sought strength in moderation.I am not losing sight of the fact that science (even thought it is inhuman) isour hope, that (even though it warps) it also saves us from a thousand warpings,that, even though it is a cruel mother, it is also a caring one. That this curse of oursis also our blessing.I am talking art into kicking—smack!—but not so that the professor feelskicked but for the artist to feel that he is the one doing the kicking. I am not seekingto crush science, but to restore art to its own life, in full counterdistinction. Let thepoodle ingratiating itself on its hind legs ﬁnally bite someone! After listening to a‘‘modern’’ concert, after attending an art exhibit, after reading today’s books, I getfaint with this weakness, as if I were facing capitulation and mystiﬁcation at thesame time. One simply does not know who is speaking: a poet—or an ‘‘educated,cultivated, well-oriented and well-informed man’’? The artist whose voice seemeddivine not long ago today creates as if he were faking it. And he creates like a pupil.Like a specialist. Like a scholar. Enough of this outrage!

Get ahold of yourself, rhetoric of hooligans!But, artists, what else is left?Yesterday in the bar. With a certain sociologist, or psychoanalyst. I sat before him, like before a bureaucrat’s window—on the other side ofwhich someone is engaged in accounting, adding, cataloging, a whole processinaccessible to me yet deﬁning. I felt as if I were in the hands of a surgeon ordespot. I expounded to him on my homegrown convictions—but what were myindividual convictions compared with his, which have debrained three hundredthousand minds in a thousand years, which are a mountain made of submissiveand functional heads.Nec Hercules contra plures!But when I kicked him in the shins, he cried out! Oh, how liberating theshriek of a scholar is!

Speaking seriously, though, artists, you must strike. Well, perhaps not witha ﬁst, because you might encounter stout men among them.But it would be really wonderful if they felt our hostility. Then they wouldunderstand that not everyone judges them according to their usefulness and thegoods they deliver. I will tell you what happened to my provider. This functionarywas very pleased with himself, his function as a deliverer of baked goods wassocially positive, everybody respected him; he felt, therefore, that he could allowhimself a bow-legged ﬁgure, shallow mug, dull look, general mediocrity and drab-ness, in conjunction with indecision and an ample dose of the fragmentary.I had to strike hard, therefore, once, twice, and draw blood, so that hewould feel that who you are is more important than what you do.Science is allowed to chase proﬁt. Art must guard the human form!1961501Tuesday
That communism is scientiﬁc in theory—that these two worlds, scienceand communism, are closely related—that, therefore science has a communizingtendency—why this is as clear as day! Not long ago I was explaining to ProfessorTeranów (in Quequén) that if the young people at the universities usually like redit is not the work of agitators but the result of their scientiﬁc culture. They honorand profess knowledge; communism appears to them in the aureole of scientism.Authentic kinship with the preeminent spirit of science is revolution’strump card in the game for the conquest of the world. If they reach their goal, itwill be on this wave of science, which crashes over everything. Strange, on theother hand, is the behavior of art in the cold war—how could it not notice that itsplace is on the opposite side of the barricade? This is really quite amazing—art hasso much anticommunism in its blood—occasionally I catch myself in the act ofthinking that even though I might yield occasionally to my strong sympathies forsome of their achievements there, behind the curtain, as an artist I must be ananticommunist, or, in other words, that I could be a communist only by resigningfrom that portion of my humanity which expresses itself in art.Of course! If art is ‘‘the most personal thing,’’ if it is ‘‘the most privatepossession one can imagine,’’ if art is the personality, the ‘‘I’’ . . . Try, you adherentsof combines and collective farms, to tell Chopin that the Sonata in B Minor is nothis. Or that he is not the Sonata in B Minor and in the wildest, most ruthlessfashion. Oh, I can imagine the dancing clown of artism seducing, loving, goingcrazy, thirsty for superiority and all the luxuries and not allowing itself to be ruled,apprehended, described—I can imagine this little, incomprehensible, but arrogantimp under the aegis of your regulation, fulﬁlling cozily and usefully its prescribedfunctions. How amusing this is: the madness of art, its conﬂagration, against thebackground of a stable, reasoned morality and all of this ‘‘socialization.’’It eluded Marx that art is and will always remain his implacable enemy,whatever the circumstances, independent of the system of production that feeds it.Did he know art too little? And did he, like all those who do not know enoughabout it, not appreciate its elementary, explosive character? He felt that it is, or canbe—civilized, normal, positive. He did not understand that it is an outlet, anexplosion. And that from it one ﬁnds exactly what Marxism is incapable of fathom-502Volume 2ing. Communism’s romance with art, which continues to this day and has bornesuch grotesquely miserable fruit, should be credited to the humble loyalty of theholy doctors and acolytes of the red church.On the other hand—haven’t the funds expended on the maintenance of‘‘artistic production’’ and cultural tenderness to the artist been paid back lavishly?As mismatched as this couple was, it managed to create the appearance of acommon front for decades. They said to art: —You must accompany us. In thename of progress! Morality! Humanitarianism! Justice! They lacked no arguments.They inundated art with arguments.And today’s artist, who has lost his instinct, is especially sensitive to argu-ments. This is what has been happening to him since the time when, intimidatedby science, he drowned his temperament in intellect and began to smell theﬂowers not with his nose but with his soul. What should one demand from thenaive but noble-minded scruples of those ‘‘working on themselves,’’ perfectingthemselves, analyzing, constructing their morality, trembling in the face of theirresponsibilities, suffering for all of humanity, those researchers, teachers, leaders,judges, inspectors, engineers of souls, ﬁnally martyrs, sometimes even saints—butnot dancers, singers. . . . Art fried up in laboratories . . . but what should onedemand from these fried eggs, what can this omelet possibly resist?I am not thinking of political warfare. . . . Away with politics, art! Beyourself, pure and simple! Watch your nature, nothing more.

—How am I supposed to believe you when you make art a champion of thepersonality? You say that this ‘‘is the most personal expression of man,’’ that art is‘‘I’’? Yet how many times have you wailed that man can never express himself fully?Your own words are: ‘‘to be a man means never to be oneself’’—for the form inwhich we manifest ourselves is formed between us and other people, it is imposedon us. . . . You even claimed that we are ‘‘created’’ by others, from the outside. . . .And art? And the artist? How can you say that ‘‘Chopin is the Sonata in B Minor’’ ifyou have concluded that the work creates itself to a great degree with its own logicand is limited by its own exigencies? How can you accuse scientists of being warped1961503by science, when, according to you, art warps its people in the very same way,creating itself beyond the artist, imposing a form on him? . . .—Allow me. I do not deny that art is ‘‘extrahuman’’ or, more accurately,‘‘interhuman.’’ But an artist is different from the scientist in that he wants to behimself. . . . And haven’t I already written in this diary that this ‘‘I want to be me’’ isthe whole secret of personality, this will, this desire, deﬁnes our attitude towarddeformation and results in the fact that deformation begins to hurt. And even ifexternal forces crush me like a wax ﬁgurine, I will remain myself as long as Iagonize over it, protest against it. Our authentic form is contained in the protestagainst deformation.—And you claim that this protest is alien to scholars?—Yes of course! They—objective—always ready to dissolve in their matter-of-fact truth . . . no, they are not called to experience disharmony between man andform! If they concern themselves with this at all, they do it scientiﬁcally—that is,without suffering—that is, without experience. . . .—You think, therefore, that this pain, this experience, can be felt only bythe artist?—Oh, no! This is the daily torment of every man; but perhaps it is moreconcentrated in those who devote themselves with greater passion to expressingthemselves. . . .

And notice that the invasion of science promises art the most beautifulcareer.We will one day recognize art as our sole friend and champion; it will evenbecome our only identiﬁcation card.Yes! Just think! Upon waking one morning you may notice that, as a conse-quence of biophysiological methods applied to you, another head had grown outof your rear during the night. Terriﬁed, you will become disoriented and no longerknow which of these heads is your real one—what will remain except to cry out interror, rebellion, protest, despair . . . that you protest!This cry will then ﬁnd its poet . . . and will declare that you are still thesame being you were yesterday.504Volume 2As for me, I expect the future scientiﬁc world to conﬁrm what Ferdydurkeproclaims about a distance to form and about not identifying with it. Tomorrow’sart, the art of deformed people, will rise under this sign. . . .They will consciously create their form (their physical form, too). But theywill not identify with it.

I wouldn’t give three cents that Scriabin got to the (altered) quartet chordin Prometheus independently of Liszt. And then—how should one trace the subse-quent path of this chord in Debussy, Mahler, Dukas, and Richard Strauss?And as for the quartet-sextet chord, does the ﬁfth, I ask, being its base, really‘‘play’’ emotionally—is this not convention upheld by the cadences of classic con-certs (perhaps with a more codal theme)?Hm, hmmm . . .

The unexpected visit of Siegrist, who is currently staying in New York andhas spent the past two years at Yale and Cambridge. He came with J. C. Gomez.He seemed somewhat lukewarm to me, the ﬂame that had warmed him in LaTroya has gone out in this splendid man. As is his custom, he began drawingﬁgures on paper that I hospitably slipped to him.Both claim (but this seems to be mainly Siegrist’s opinion) that the recentslowing down of the tempo in physics must be attributed not so much to theexhaustion of philosophical possibilities in the area of chief, inseminating contra-dictions of the type continuity-noncontinuity, macro-micro cosmos, wave and cor-puscular interpretation, gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds, etc., as to the factthat physics has fallen prey to a system of interpretation shaped in the intellectualexchanges of scholars. They are thinking of the polemics between Bohr-Einstein,Heisenberg-Bohr, all the opinions exchanged about the Compton effect, the coex-istence of such minds as Broglie, Planck, Schrödinger, that entire ‘‘dialogue,’’which, in their opinion, delineated the issues and their centers imperceptibly,gradually, but prematurely and arbitrarily, creating the necessity of moving along a1961505certain line. This happened of itself, as a result of their desire for precision.—Theseare the sad consequences of too much talk—noticed Gomez. They said a little toomuch. . . .When I allowed myself to draw attention to the rare scrupulosity of themajority of these scholars in controlling their system of interpretation and delineat-ing its role and cognitive limits, when I gave Einstein as an example, I noticed thatSiegrist was writing something down on paper. He was writing out the word‘‘mach’’ in capital letters.And he added:—Stocks are dropping.

The riddle of ‘‘light’’ in Mozart. Gide is quite right when he says that thedrama in Mozart’s music, illuminated by intelligence, spirit, stops being dramatic.The kind of splendor found in the ﬁrst allegro of the Jupiter Symphony is thecrowning glory of this internal process. Radiance conquers and reigns supreme. Butin him, as in Leonardo da Vinci, I see an element of perversity, a kind of illegalretreating from life—Mozart’s and Leonardo’s smile (especially in his sketches)have this same characteristic, it is as if they wanted a forbidden amusement, as ifthey wanted to play and delight even in that which is forbidden, even in that whichgives pain . . . a delicate but roguish game, sly, an archintelligent sensuality . . . buteven the very juxtaposition ‘‘intelligent sensuality’’ is sinful. . . . Is the ascending anddescending scale in Don Giovanni not a strange joke which pokes fun at hell? Thehigh registers of Mozart sometimes assail me like something forbidden, like sin.The reverse of Mozart would be Chopin—for here the afﬁrmation of weak-ness, delicacy, executed with rare determination and stubbornness, results instrength and the capacity to look at life without ﬂinching. He ‘‘insists so muchon what is his,’’ he wants to be who he is so absolutely that this makes him reallyexist—makes him unrelenting and, as a phenomenon, invincible. Thus, in self-506Volume 2conﬁrmation, Chopin’s despairing, lost, morbid romanticism, subjected to theforces of the world like a reed to wind, transforms itself into a severe classicism, intodiscipline, into mastery of matter, into the will to rule. How moving and sublimehis heroism is when seen this way, and how declamatory, rhetorical, and paltrywhen one looks at it from a ‘‘patriotic’’ perspective. ‘‘I will cling most strongly towhat is weakest in me’’—his work seems to shout.

An exchange of letters with Adam Czerniawski and indirectly with Czayk-nowski, on the occasion of the appearance of the English edition of Ferdydurke, aswell as the discussion about Wiadomo´ sci and Kultura in Kontynenty, leads me to wonder whether I should write in greater detail about this group of young émigréwriters, so vehement in their Polish start on London soil. This would not cost memuch and might come in handy to them. . . .Scarcely do I dream this idea when I back out of it convulsively. I amﬂushed out by my revulsion to the collective character of literature. Oh dear,groups! Unions! Debuts! ‘‘Writers,’’ ‘‘young writers,’’ ‘‘old writers,’’ ‘‘the younggeneration,’’ ‘‘new values!’’ . . . It is enough for me to notice someone in literatureand begin reading him for him to stop being a ‘‘writer’’ and to become Pasek,Chesterton, tout court. I see nothing in art except names.If a spark of spiritual alliance did ﬂare up between one of these youngpeople and me, that someone would become . . . merely himself . . . not a literatusor a young person or a beginning writer in exile. But sparks do not ﬂy so easily. It is
*Italicized phrase in English in original.1961507easier to establish contact with young people in Poland, not here with thesealready one-quarter Englishmen, half-choked by the muzzle of their acquiredEnglish culture. Their Englishness stiﬂes, inhibits, their Polishness. Their Polish-ness does not allow their Englishness to be grafted onto them. Their task is uncom-monly difﬁcult, almost breakneck: to join the two spheres in such a way as togenerate a little electricity and loosen their tongues. (It would come easier to themif they wrote in English, like Conrad, like Pietrkiewicz, then their deepest Polishexoticism would intoxicate them.)Peculiar this shrub rising in our émigré garden—and on such inhospitablesoil.

It is true that I sometimes demolish,with gusto, in jest, by attacking, writers, but only those who prance around in theirepaulets. I have never really taken part in a single duel while clad in my stripes andepaulets; I have never written a single word dressed in anything but my birthday suit.

Now people are accusing me of mystiﬁcation. Not long ago a womancharged up to me in the Polish Center:—You mystify! It is never clear whether youare being serious, paradoxical, or just blufﬁng.—A nitwit—I answered—fears nothing more than being turned into one.This fear never leaves him: they are putting me on! But listen, nitwit, what goodwill it do you to know whether I am ‘‘sincere’’ or ‘‘insincere’’? What does this haveto do with whether or not my thoughts are right? I can utter a soaring truth‘‘insincerely’’ and say the stupidest thing ‘‘sincerely.’’ Learn to judge the thoughtindependently of who says it or how.508Volume 2Sure, mystiﬁcation is advisable for a writer. Let him muddle the watersaround himself a bit so that no one knows who he is—a clown perhaps? Scoffer?Wise man? Cheat? Discoverer? Blusterer? Guide? Or perhaps he is all of these atonce? Enough of this blissful sleep in the womb of mutual trust. Be vigilant, spirit!Be prepared!And so long, nitwits!

An enticing little morning, an idling little springtime, dust motes dancingin the streaks and streams of sunlight—oooh, ahhhh, I am happy to pull on mytrousers with the thought that I am going for a walk, a little walk, I’ll relax, I walk tothe door—the bell, Irmgard goes to open the door and in a minute in walks Simon.So I say: —Hola, what are you doing here at this early hour? Have a seat,companiero! To which he replies: —How are you?—and he sits down—sits down—sits down somewhat too easily perhaps, too quickly, or perhaps because he sitsdown in the nearest chair—enough that he immediately alienates me with histerrifying absence.I say something again—he to me—but this conversation is and is not—as forhim, it looks as if ‘‘he had forgotten to take himself along.’’ It was as if . . . yes, as if hewere not there. But what do I know, after all. . . . I smile and keep talking whensuddenly his upper lip quivers, in a bad way, in a bad, bad way.He looks. Explains. A vat. A vat full of boiling water.His daughter.A vat ﬁlled with boiling water spills on his daught . . .So, I see . . . and ‘‘it has been going on for hours in the hospital and is stillnot over’’ and he ‘‘doesn’t know what to do with himself’’ and he ‘‘is of absolutelyno use,’’ so he came. And he apologizes for intruding at such an early hour.—Noproblem! Of course, certainly . . . But I go silent, he goes silent and we sit, if I can1961509express it this way, nose to nose. Face to face. Alone. Hand to hand. Foot to foot.Knee to knee. Face to face. Until this stupid identity begins to irritate me in theroom and I think, how is it that he repeats me, that I repeat him, face to face—all ofa sudden the scalding of the child scalds me until I hiss—and then I see that eventhough we are so similar, there is no use sitting here and it is better simply not to sitat all but to leave, leave, leave, exit, any kind of exit; distance, removal, becomeurgent, burning! . . . And I say: —Shall we take a walk? He gets up immediately andwe leave; ﬁrst I and he behind me with that daughter of his.Zephyr.We go out and the fact that we go out is just right. So we go. I immediatelyturn right, although I could go left—streets, houses, sidewalks, movement, hubub,ringing, honking, look—someone is hopping into a tram, someone is bending over,someone is biting into a chocolate bar, someone is buying something from avendor—we feel better immediately at the sight of this hive with hands, feet, ears,like us, but alien, as if it were innocent. . . . And what relief! . . . because eventhough that evil thing is lodged in us, there on the street corner people call out toone another! They greet each other from afar!I choose the most crowded streets to lose myself in the throng and disap-pear—and I gamble that this is a race with time, that his daughter cannot keepdying endlessly, it has to end somehow, and then Simon will leave me alone. Ihaven’t the least idea what is going on in him, a conﬂagration or frost—he walksnext to me. Sun. I see a fruit vendor on the corner, he is weighing apples andsomehow I like it that he knows nothing and is weighing a kilo of apples, talking toa customer . . . his ignorance appeals to me so much that I think that I, too, will buysome apples and will at least relax for a moment with this man, rest, somewhere athis place, far away. . . . —A kilo?—said the fruit vendor.—Right away. Everyone isbuying them because they are as sweet as pears.Suddenly I blurt out:—A terrible thing has happened to this man, he has afour-year-old daughter and she is dying.I bite my tongue . . . why?! It is out! Never mind. He weighs the apples. I amhumbled in this silence and empty, like an eraser rubbing away everything. Howawful—says the fruit vendor—such a misfortune!When I hear this, it grows in me, unwinds, jumps and howls all in onesecond, bursting all boundaries . . . I shout:510Volume 2—Take these apples away! Take them!Lightning bolt. I move forward, blindly, like a man possessed! Behind meSimon with his little daughter, like a man possessed! And again we are alone, heand I, I and he, but this time the secret is out, the war declared, trumpets anddrums, the march is beginning!And at exactly this moment, note, a dog barks (I do not see him, I merelyhear his barking).Trams! Buses! Swarm of passersby! The street is unrolling itself like acarpet, I walk on, after me him, and after him, his daughter! We walk in my out-burst, in my outburst to the fruit vendor, which revealed, betrayed, and announced. . . and it no longer helps us to be immersing ourselves in the throng, my cry followsus and behind it that horror . . . and with it something like an animal, why has ananimal joined in? An animal? I am thinking of the dog’s barking. Well, a dog not atiger . . . at any rate this barking joins my outburst, my outburst, I remember it now,it rings out together with the barking of the dog and as a result my outburst changesa little into some kind of animal, well, it is enough that the animal is, that it hasalready joined in, dog or no dog. An animal. We walk. He walks. I walk. Out of acornucopia come houses, windows, streets, street corners, signs, displays, and thehuman swarm, in which we are immersing ourselves more and more quickly, inorder to lose ourselves . . . what will I do? Where are we going? What should wedo? . . . but we go down Florida Street, where the crowds are greatest, and we tearthrough, push, rub shoulders. Until we stop because a passing omnibus blocks ourway and an elderly gentleman asks Simon, very politely:—Pardon me . . . Which way to Corrientes?Simon looks at him and does not answer.Then a little taken aback, the man turns to me with his question. And Ilook at him—and don’t answer. no. I agree, it is nothing too unusual, he probablythinks he has come upon foreigners who do not know the language . . . neverthe-less, you must understand, this is a no and a shove into nothingness . . . as if a knifewere cutting it away. This is a refusal, a dark, black, remote refusal in the brightsun. And we move ahead, like madmen, and then the shriek of a parrot reaches us,who knows from where, maybe from a passing taxi, this shriek joins to my earlieroutburst and renews the earlier barking of the dog . . . and the Animal again makesitself heard and suddenly tears into our lack of an answer! Nothing. I still do not1961511know what is in him, in Simon, although I am the same as he, and alone with him!Nor does he know about me. But bound by our outburst and by our lack of ananswer, isolated and marked like criminals, we quicken our pace to get lost in thecrowd, when the end loomed before me—the end, I say, which makes me feelqueasy. . . .Namely, Florida is ending. Before us the square—the Plaza San Martin—asif on a platter.Return to Florida? But no . . . because we walk in a hurry, as if we weregoing somewhere and this would reveal that our movement is a lie!Enter the square? Except that there are almost no people there. What arewe to do in that square—the two of us, alone!Too late for second thoughts. We are walking through the very center of thesquare—it is cool, quiet, fresh, and the wind blows over us from afar. The suddendistance practically knocks our feet out from under us. The square is sublime,overlooking the port and river, it hovers like a balcony, and there, in the distance,in the black and blue combinations of water, fog, and white sky, ﬂoats the cringingor straight smoke from ships immobile on the river, and this immobility of ships onthe immobile river together with the stone skeleton of the port, sharp with thespines of buildings—from here, from the mountain—smells of stagnation andbackwardness. We slow our pace. Stillness. Emptiness. Peace. Our gallop hasexhausted itself, broken down in the immobility—and we stop. Suddenly our walkhas completely exhausted itself.What?Face-to-face, but I have no idea what he is doing with himself in there—perhaps something, perhaps nothing—I have no idea. We stand, he a little to theside, and we stand, and there, in the distance, some sort of immobile gloom isforming and growing between the glassy water and the watery heaven of steam, fog,clouds of smoke, in the stillness of ships imperceptibly moving, in the lifelessoutline of port fortiﬁcations. Silence, silence, when a piece of paper rustles at ourfeet, moved by the wind. I look at my companion out of the corner of my eye—he isholding the paper down with the tip of his shoe and his eyes are riveted to theground. The paper rustles again. I glue my eyes to the paper, he glues his eyes tothe paper.Again the paper rustles. Then he looks at me with furrowed brow, with a512Volume 2look so concentrated and penetrating that it seems he is preparing to say somethingmost urgent, important, and conclusive, in the greatest haste . . . but he saysnothing, the paper rustles, he holds the paper down with his foot and looks at me,and there far away it goes on, grows and ﬂoats. . . . I think, what will happen if thepaper rustles again?One-on-one. I prefer not to look at him and in not looking at him, I beginto wonder if I am in danger . . . will he . . . me? . . .It is important for me to substantiate this thought, it is not at all fantastic, Iwould not want to be accused of lacking common sense. . . . Let us agree: a mansubject to such pressure could explode, is it not true that he could explode? But thevery explosion worries me less—the nature of the explosion, more. For, let usunderstand that I do not know what is going on inside him, and more may be goingon . . . well, much more may be going on than custom anticipates and one couldeven ask if this tormented creature is still residing with both feet in our, humanworld . . . and in general this story is risky and elusive beyond expression, yes,risky . . . but perhaps I would not be so disturbed if not for the paper, if not for thepaper ﬂapping under his foot, like something living, like an animal, you see,completely like a shout turned into an animal, the result being that the animaljoins us again, but this time, how shall I say it, low, at the very bottom, because it isno longer from a dog, a parrot, but from a piece of paper, a lifeless thing, and there,low, the Animal with the child answers, the child-animal. . . . And I wrack mybrains, wrack my brains, why is the child turning into an animal, but there is nohelping it, one has to bear it—except, that I am relating to ‘‘man’’ with suspicion, toa man who stands in a void, next to me, a man for whom a dying child has becomean animal and who carries this within himself. . . . I do not believe in the devil.Simon is a good person by nature, he wouldn’t harm a ﬂy. Except that . . . thistime . . . There is no grace to be found anywhere. Not a penny’s worth.What then might he be capable of . . . if the paper rustles again? (This is allconnected to the paper.) But the breeze has died down. I prefer not to look at himtoo much. The worst thing is that this kind of animal is an unknown to me, even upclose, but the fact that it comes from the child, and is linked to a dog and a parrotand paper, does not inspire conﬁdence. There on the outskirts smoke and streaksof fog. A child? An animal? What kind of animal? I should not, in any case, havetaken a walk with him, this is really unprovidential and now I have to duck out,1961513detach myself—before it becomes too late—and what are we doing here like thisanyway, on this elevated square, alone, one-on-one, without anyone except forus. . . . I have to detach myself. But how should I detach myself? Quickly, quickly,because at any moment the paper might rustle . . . it is really silly that even thoughhe is so similar to me, nose for nose, ear for ear, foot for foot, I haven’t the least ideaas to what he might do!I calculate that if I leave suddenly, at least a moment will pass before he canmove—during which I can reach the stairs and quickly run down the stairs alone.Except . . . how am I to leave so abruptly? . . . I go silent inside—and then under theinﬂuence of my silence that silence returns to me, the silence with which wereceived the gentleman who asked me about Corrientes; that silence of oursreturns together with the deafness and blindness, and in this deafness and blind-ness, I break with him, I suddenly leave!I am already on the stairs. I am running down. This escape is like achallenge! Because I am ﬂeeing from something like an evil spirit! And he remainsbehind like an evil spirit! Suddenly a diabolical evil ﬁnds itself between us. I washoping to come upon a station and lose myself in it—I run, I run inside, I dive intoa crowd and ﬁnally I stand in line for the cashier, any kind of cashier, just to stand.—Where to?—asks the clerk at the window.—To Tigre—I say the ﬁrst station thatcomes to mind, because it’s all the same, the important thing is to get on a train, toget away. But I hear behind me: —To Tigre—And it is his voice.This frightened me and I am not joking!Actually there is nothing shocking about all this—the two of us step out fora walk, then the two of us buy a ticket for a suburban train . . . well, yes, except that Iam running away . . . and he, in order to catch me, has to run after me and thisrunning after me is pursuit. . . . At any rate, he attaches himself to me again. Andthis time I am no longer able to escape, the possibility of escape has already beenexhausted. So we take our tickets and together, shoulder to shoulder, await ourtrain in a great hall of glass and iron; we stand over a line of sleek tracks, whereslowly the passengers gather—we wait for the train.Which is not arriving. We wait. He says nothing. I don’t know what is inhim, what he is like now, where he is going. I know nothing—zero—about this facestaring at the tracks—and, at the same time, in proportion to the arrival of people,our intimacy grows, our acquaintance forces us to stand next to one another, it514Volume 2creates a pair of us. Who is this creature standing next to me and what sort ofanimal has his child—which he has with him—become? My common sense, ashealthy as it is, does not leave me for an instant in these obsessions of fear andabout ten times I become furious at my fantasies and chimeras—but—but—oncethe facade of the ordinary shatters, the place we occupy in the cosmos becomeswhat it is in essence—something abysmally inconceivable and therefore contain-ing the possibility of everything. After all, I would not even concern myself withthis too much—if not for a certain drastic detail, if not for a certain reptile, conceal-ing itself in the dark womb of being—if not for the Pain—yes, if the riddle did notcause pain!Pain! Only this is important—the cruel eyes of Pain in this black well—painhurts!—This merciless ﬁnger transforms everything it touches into reality—evenfantasy becomes truth in contact with this real thing, pain. I wouldn’t make any-thing of this if it didn’t hurt; but I have already been informed about the pain of thechild in the hospital, the terrible pain that hurts here, right next to me, in thisman—and this horror is not a delusion, because it hurts!—and I am close, close . . .and maybe it is beginning to look at me . . . that animal of a burned child . . . I dowhat I can to conceal it from myself, or, too, myself from it, but the undevelopedthought about the child turned into an animal, a bad thought . . . Animal? Whatkind of animal? The barking of a dog, a parrot, rustling paper, ah, I weave my deaf,dumb, blind arabesques from anything at hand and they would be so harmless if itdidn’t hurt, it hurts, O the pain, the pain, it hurts!—except for the pain of a childconﬁrming my fancies!Meanwhile more people arrive, Sunday travelers with bags and in spite ofeverything their normal demeanor somehow soothes our unusualness—until atrain rolls into the vastness of the iron-glass hall, pigeons in the vault—and togetherwith others we board, he and I—and we are conﬁned to an overﬂowing train car.Whistles. The train moves. In a moment it emerges into the sun, devouring thetracks that run out of the sides of the road with a rhythmic rocking. We ride therelaxing, ﬂeeing space and I am already thinking about what I am supposed to doin this Tigre for which I am headed, when—Tigre? Tigre! Why Tigre?!Why to Tigre, for what, to do what? . . . And why not to some other station?In the crush I can see practically nothing through the gaps created by chins, spines,1961515collars, and necks, but I feel hijacked to Tigre . . . why to Tigre? . . . and I know thatin the train there is not one person who is going the way I am going there with him,without reason, so completely blindly (and deaﬂy) to Tigre . . . and with the samekind of baggage. I look, truly amazed, at their faces, so similar, it is possible thatthey may even look like us—and this fact becomes a springboard for a mad leap,that we are going to Tigre without reason, borne away by the train. Tigre? What iswaiting for us in Tigre? The train stops, then moves. I feel something . . . nearby . . .some sort of machination, some sort of indistinct effort to overpower . . . me . . .thirst for conquest . . . of me.This is indistinct. Murky, dark, quiet. He stands next to me, squeezed. Thisis not a distinct, possessive movement—nothing of the kind. I catch him in rathertiny almost preliminary doings—the movement of a hand, perhaps the shifting ofweight from foot to foot, the shy, crowded movement of an elbow—perhaps this isnatural in the discomfort, but I seem to see something, that it is not he who ismoving, but something within him . . . something I fear desperately, a child turnedinto an animal, that animal of his, which is endowed with its own movement likethe rustling paper and which possesses him. Again I feel in him the movement,something like the movement of a fetus in a mother’s womb, and I feel thepresence of an evil with fangs, claws, furiously evil. I cringe again, for the cry of thatchild, in the hospital, really is—so my delirium has real fangs!Then I realize: Tigre—tiger! Which has not occurred to me until now. Sowe speed on to Tigre . . . and I would laugh to tears over this, if not for the child inthe hospital making it come true!Simon moves again!—or it moves in him—and I run to get away—but inthe crush all I can do is move away from him spasmodically and thus, moving myentire body, I crawl onto another—soft—body. An enormous, warm obesity whoseface I do not see, into whom, out of horror, I am falling, into a sweaty, awkward,vulvar softness, into a probably quiet, humble, decent obesity, hospitable if suf-focating. Oh, what a cozy little corner this is! . . . in which I slowly domesticatemyself, make myself at home . . . in the warmth of his shirt plays today’s andyesterday’s sweat, mingled with the scent of vanilla, in his pocket he has a notepad,on his lining a label with the name of the tailor smart, the shirt is patched. It isquiet here and good, a hundred miles from that . . . burning . . . problem, that other516Volume 2thing is completely inconceivable, it is something completely different, a differentcountry, respite and calm . . . at the other end of the world. Finally! I am resting. Iam elated. And suddenly a terrible blow is dealt beneath me from beneath.I say ‘‘beneath me from beneath’’ because this is neither simply ‘‘beneathme’’ nor simply ‘‘from beneath,’’ just as if it were divided and doubled—do youunderstand?—and this was not really a blow, rather a grabbing; and this grabbingwas not ‘‘executed,’’ but was becoming like a threat on my periphery . . . andsuddenly I understand that my moment of laxity has been taken advantage of inorder practically to bite! I freeze. My head is stuck between his chest and jacket. Icannot pray. I cannot move. I cannot shout. No, I cannot shout, but a god-awfulshout breaks out from all over and embraces everything, tumbles headlong into theheartrending Animal to the very bottom. And, with my head hidden, immobile, Iwait for it to jump.But then . . .Something . . . something . . . something! What? Hm . . . Suddenly . . .something like a tickling on the back of the neck. Can’t be. Perhaps someone haspulled out a handkerchief and is touching the back of my neck? No. Someone istickling me. Deliberately, his ﬁngers on the back of my neck. . . .I wonder. What could this be? Who?The fat man? Why? I take all the possible solutions into consideration:madman, homo, joker.Simon? Has he gone mad? Even if he has gone crazy, he cannot reach myneck from where he is.One of the people standing next to me? Maybe an acquaintance is lettingme know he is here? Highly unlikely with my head stuck in the Fat Guy.Meanwhile someone’s ﬁngers are dancing lightly down the back of myneck.I wonder—who? What? I puzzle and puzzle.I wrack and wrack my brains, what sort of joke is this—but I have noillusions for I know that the lack of connection between the tickling and theAnimal is precisely the guarantee of their diabolical afﬁliations, their plotting, theirpact—and I wait for the Tickling to get chummy with It, with the Animal, before itsinks, like a knife, into the unknown, inconceivable, still unuttered scream.Volume 3This page intentionally left blank 5191961

Before me I have Bruno Schulz in the French translation, heralded a fewweeks ago by Suzanne Arlet (the poet). It is a volume of stories entitled Traité desmannequins (chieﬂy stories from Cinnamon Shops) published by Juillard.Introductions. First Maurice Nadeau: ‘‘. . . we must assure him a placeamong the great writers of our day.’’ Followed by Sandauer’s* ﬁne study—it isobvious that he is quite at home in Schulz; he is cautious but penetrating.Bruno.I have long known about this edition prepared with such painstaking effort,yet when I ﬁnally saw the book, I winced. What will happen now? Will it be a‘‘dud’’ or a universal success? Its ties to Kafka may smooth the way or, just as easily,obstruct it. If they say, here is one more relation, he is lost. If, on the other hand,they spot his particular luminosity, the light pulsating from him like from a phos-phorizing insect, then he will glide into the imagination cultivated by Kafka andhis kin. . . . But right now in July it is impossible to say, and certainly not easy topredict the fate of this uncommon work in Paris.The devil take Paris! How exhausting this is—Paris! If not for Paris, I toowould not have to be bothered writing this souvenir about a ‘‘deceased friend,’’ Iwould have been spared this stylistic exercise.
*Artur Sandauer, a controversial postwar Polish literary critic whose studies of Schulz andGombrowicz led to discussion and reassessment of their work.520Volume 3Saturday
It would be hard to call it friendship—in the years we became acquaintedwe were both still unborn. The years 1934, 1935. Aleje Ujazdowskie. We are stroll-ing along. Talking. He and I on S™u˙ zewska. He, Witkacy, and I. Na™kowska, he, andI.* In this ﬁlm, ‘‘ﬂickering onto the screen of memory,’’ I see him as someonealmost completely unknown to me, but then I see myself that way, too—it was notus, but the introduction to us, an overture, a prologue.I would like to unload immediately an irritating impropriety, somethingmost certainly in bad taste: Bruno adored me but I did not adore him.He ﬁrst showed up at my place, on S™u˙ zewska, after the publication ofCinnamon Shops—I had just published my Memoir from Adolescence. He wassmall, strange, chimerical, focused, intense, almost feverish—and this is how ourconversations got started, usually on walks.That we truly needed one another is indisputable. We found ourselves in avacuum, our literary situations were permeated with a void, our admirers werespectral, something of the apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto, we both roamedPolish literature like a ﬂourish, ornament, chimera, grifﬁn.After reading my ﬁrst book, Bruno discovered a companion in me. He keptshowing up in order to ﬁnd conﬁrmation in me, for me to furnish him with theOutside without which an inner life is condemned to a monologue—and hewanted me to use him in the same way. He would show up as a friend, yes (Iemphasize), as a kindred spirit to consolidate and raise my esteem.And here is where the ‘‘miss’’ or ‘‘dislocation,’’ to use the language of ourworks, came in . . . for his extended hand did not meet my own. I did not return hisregard, I gave him abysmally little, almost nothing, of myself, our relationship wasa ﬁasco . . . but perhaps even this secretly worked to our advantage? Perhaps he andI needed ﬁasco rather than happy symbiosis?Today I can speak of this openly because he has died.Allow me therefore to repeat once again with delight: how he built me up,
*Aleje Ujazdowskie and S™u˙ zewska are streets in an elegant section of Warsaw. Stanis™awIgnacy Witkiewicz was a Polish playwright, novelist, painter, and philosopher. He committed suicidein September 1939. Zoﬁa Na™kowska was a well-known Polish novelist and a promoter of Schulz’swork in the period between the two wars.1961521how he strengthened me. In my melancholy literary life I have gotten my share ofshabby treatment, but I have also met people who would favor me, out of the blue,with the lavishness of a padishah—no one, however, was more generous thanBruno. Never, before or since, have I bathed in such crystalline joy on account ofmy every artistic attainment. No one ever supported me in so heartfelt a manner,no one ever delighted in me, ever stoked each and every one of my thoughts theway he did—I note: never in the course of our friendship was there any malicetoward me on Bruno’s part; indeed, he fed me the milk of human kindness. . . . Itwill sufﬁce for me to tell you what happened with Ferdydurke. I gave him theunﬁnished book, still in typescript, and he returned it within a week, his faceextinguished.—You should return to your fantasies of Memoir of Adolescence, that kind ofwriting suits you better—he said with obvious and considerable vexation.But later when he read Ferdydurke in book form he burst into a ﬂame thatalmost scorched me, cool as I was. When he had the opportunity to come toWarsaw, he gave a lecture (later reprinted in Skamander) on Ferdydurke at theWriters Union which was taken for a lot of fanfare and infuriated the mandarins ofour day.Do you think I am not aware? Of how much more tactful it would be if Idid not thrust myself to the forefront in this souvenir about a ‘‘deceased friend’’?Modesty! . . . I hasten to warn you that I am familiar with this rule in its social aswell as moral aspect. But didn’t Prince Ypsilanti say that those who know oneshould not eat ﬁsh with a knife may eat ﬁsh with a knife? So much for the drawingroom. And if you have in mind even more profound moral considerations, then Iwill say to you, quite frankly, that in maintaining silence about these things I wouldbe completely distorting what had come to exist between us—and this kind of sin,committed by a writer whose maxim is optimal proximity to reality, would beunforgivable. Perhaps I should not write about Schulz with me or me with Schulz—but would this kind of abstinence be worth recommending? Prim old maids, notliterature, should avoid dangerous subjects. Omit this? The distaste, the wearinesswith myself that overwhelms me because even here, in writing about a ‘‘deceasedfriend,’’ I have to be myself . . . I have to risk being distasteful.And what was my reaction to Schulz’s magnanimity? I liked him . . . yes.We had a lot of friendly talks, I often backed him up; in the eyes of others, we were522Volume 3a pair. Appearances! My nature never allowed me to approach him other than withincredulity; I trusted neither him nor his art. Have I honestly ever read even asingle one of his stories from start to ﬁnish? No—they bored me stiff. I had to beextremely careful, therefore, in everything I said so that he would not suspect thevoid that lay waiting in ambush for both of us. How much did he really suspect?I am not blaming myself at all for lacking the feelings to reciprocate. Onthe contrary—I consider it laudable that I did not allow myself to be bribed; I ﬁnd itquite appealing when one responds with an icy coolness to someone else’s whiteheat; an artist should not be the function of someone else’s temperature. Exceptthat . . . I did write a brief article about Bruno in the Kurier Poranny and I recalldreading that people would say I was praising him because he had praised me . . .out of this fear came an article not directly about Schulz but about how one shouldgo about reading him. And sometimes I could be quite petty toward him andperhaps this might even have been mean except that the meanness of my stingi-ness, just like the nobility of his magnanimity, was strangely deprived of all weight.Inauthentic. As if. Unreal. In virtue and in sin, we embryos were innocent.

Were we friends? Colleagues? How often we were mentioned together invarious literary inventories under ‘‘Polish experimental prose.’’ And yet if anyoneexisted in Polish art who was 100 percent my opposite, it was he.I am no longer capable of remembering whether this was ever openlystated in the dialogue we carried on with his every visit to Warsaw. But once, whilewalking down Aleje Ujazdowskie, in front of the Chopin monument, he said thateven though our works were joined by ‘‘their irony, sarcastic escapism, and game ofhide-and-seek, my spot on the map is a hundred miles away from yours, and what’smore, your voice, in order to reach mine, would have to be deﬂected by a thirdsomething or other; there is no direct telephone line between us.’’In my opinion, it was like this: Bruno was a man who was denying himself.I was a man seeking himself. He wanted annihilation. I wanted realization. Hewas born to be a slave. I was born to be a master. He wanted denigration. I wantedto be ‘‘above’’ and ‘‘superior to.’’ He was of the Jewish race. I was from a family ofPolish gentry.1961523And he was a relentless, untempered masochist—one sensed this in him allthe time. No, he was not made to dominate! A tiny gnome with an enormous head,appearing too scared to dare exist, he was ejected from life and couched along itsperipheries. Bruno did not acknowledge his right to exist, he sought his ownannihilation—not that he wanted to commit suicide; he merely ‘‘strove’’ for nonbe-ing with all his might (and this is precisely what made him, Heidegger-style, sosensitive to being). In my opinion there was no sense of guilt à la Kafka in thisstriving, it was more like the instinct that moves a sick animal to separate, removeitself. He was superﬂuous. He was extraneous. It is possible that his masochism alsohad a different aspect, I don’t know, but it most certainly was homage paid to thepowers of being that were trampling him.What should a man cast out of life do? He can do nothing but take refugein the Spirit—and it will be God if he is a believer; Morality if he is not a believerbut a moral man; Art if he has deiﬁed beauty. . . . Bruno was not so much adisbeliever in God as he was uninterested in him, and even though he demon-strated a profound moral sense in all his dealings, he was not at all disposed tomorality conceived as doctrine and conscious dictate of action. So only art re-mained. . . . And indeed, I saw him completely devoted to it, consumed by it with azeal and concentration I had never seen in anyone else—he was a fanatic of art, itsslave. He entered this cloister and submitted to its rigors, carrying out its strictestinjunctions with great humility in order to attain perfection.Except that he never attained sanctiﬁcation.As far as I got to know Bruno, a man not at all easy to get to know, hismasochistic inclinations, duly thrown into relief by Sandauer, make up the key tothe spiritual defeat that befell him in his last refuge—in art. Yes, the dialectic ofpleasure and pain peculiar to masochism (and characteristic of art as well), andeven more so the desire for self-destruction, can explain a great deal.What happens when a monk who is ﬂagellating himself with enthusiasmbefore a holy image suddenly feels that the whip has stopped being the instrumentof torture and has become the instrument of ecstasy? The logical development ofthis situation would lead us to a macabre paradox: the sinner, to attain salvation,thinks up more and more horriﬁc tortures, yet the greater the pain the greater thefun, the more delicious the sin!Never mind about the pain. Let us talk about the self-destruction. This524Volume 3holy artist—such do occur—could most certainly have drawn so much dignity andpride, so much spirit, from the splendor of artistic attainments that his biologicaldecrepitude would have become less important. He could have come into exis-tence in another sphere, because life was rejecting him. He who humbles himselfwill be exalted—he could have risen this way. But what if degradation and humilitycost him nothing, what if they had no moral value in him, on the contrary, hewas pleased by everything that degraded him, everything that hurled him to theground. He approached art as if it were a lake he intended to drown in. Falling tohis knees before the Spirit, he experienced sensual pleasure. He wanted to be aservant, nothing more. He craved nonexistence.Such are the trials of someone who likes the taste of the lash!And if he called art ‘‘betrayal’’ or a ‘‘feint,’’ it was due to this perversion.

And it was with a perverse artist like this that I made friends. Since hegroveled with delectation and kneeled sensually, couldn’t art at least have becomea tool of his personality even momentarily, something that he could put to his ownspiritual or simply personal use? Hermes, Sandauer calls him. No, no, to my mindthere wasn’t much Hermes in him; he was useless as an intermediary betweenspirit and matter. In fact, his perverse attitude to being (the Heideggarian question‘‘Why does Something and not Nothing exist?’’ could be the motto of his work)resulted in the fact that for him matter became illuminated by the spirit, and thespirit was incarnated, but this Hermes-like process is spiced with the desire to‘‘debilitate’’ being: matter is corrupt, diseased, or insidiously hostile, or mystifying,and the spiritual world is transformed into an utterly sensual phantasmagoria ofcolor and light, its spiritual purpose is corrupted. To replace existence with half-existence, or with the appearance of existence—such were Bruno’s secret dreams.He also wanted to weaken matter as well as the spirit. We often discussed variousmoral and social issues but behind everything he said crouched the passivity ofsomeone brought to ruin. As an artist he was completely ﬁxed in the very materialof his work, in his own game and internal arrangements, when he wrote a story hehad no other law beyond the immanent law of the unfolding form. A false ascetic,sensuous saint, lascivious monk, nihilistic fulﬁller. And he knew this.1961525While he subordinated himself to art this way, I wanted to be ‘‘above’’ it.This was our chief disagreement.I hail, as I have said, from the landed gentry, and this is a burden almostequally strong and only a bit less tragic than to have behind one those thousands ofyears of Jewish banishment. The ﬁrst work I wrote at age eighteen was the history ofmy family, based on household archives that encompassed four hundred years ofafﬂuent living in Samogitia.* A landowner—whether he is a Polish squire or anAmerican farmer makes no difference—will always harbor distrust of culture, forhis remoteness from the great centers of human activity makes him resistant tohuman confrontations and products. And he will have the nature of a master. Hewill demand that culture be for him, not he for culture; all that is humble service,devotion, sacriﬁce, will appear suspect to him. To which of the Polish gentry whoimported paintings from Italy in their day would it have occurred to humblehimself before a masterpiece hanging on the wall? Not to a single one. Both theworkers and the artists who created them were treated high-handedly.I, on the other hand, traitor and derider of my ‘‘class’’ that I was, belongedto it nevertheless—and I have probably already said that many of my roots are to befound in the epoch when the gentry was most unrestrained, the eighteenth cen-tury. I am very much from the Saxon period. For this reason, then, Bruno, kneelingbefore art, was completely unacceptable. But that’s not all. Having one leg in thejolly world of the landed gentry, another in the world of the intellect and avant-garde literature, I was in between worlds. Being in-between is not a bad wayto elevate yourself—for in applying the principle of divide et impera you canbring about the mutual devouring of the two worlds and then escape and soar‘‘above’’ them.I had the habit of passing myself off as an artist with my relatives in thecountry (to irritate them), and with artists I passed myself off as a ﬁrst-rate landedgentleman (to infuriate them in turn).I was always irritated by artists who were too fanatic. I can’t stand poetswho are poets too much, and painters too devoted to painting. I generally wantman not to devote himself to anything entirely. I want that he always be a littledetached from what he does. Bruno was more of an artist than all of the poètes
*The ethnic heartland of Lithuania.526Volume 3maudits put together, and for the paradoxical reason that he did not adore art at all.In adoring, one is someone, and he preferred to lose himself in it, to vanishaltogether.I, on the other hand, wanted to be myself, myself, not an artist or an idea orany of my works—just myself. I wanted to be above art, writing, style, ideas.
Tuesday
He liked me to attack him. Actually I even have the impression that heunderstood a really strange fact—namely, that I, having known him for so long, didnot even take the trouble to read his book. He was discreet and did not quiz me onit, knowing I would fail the test. (But perhaps he knew—the way I did—that high artalmost always remains unread, that it acts differently somehow, by its very presencein a given culture?) Everything that went into my knowledge of him (and still goesinto it) derives from the bits of reading (which dazzled me) combined with bits thathave remained from our many conversations. Did he perhaps relish my despisingit? And put me on a pedestal because I despised it?I was also astonished by his keen and easy understanding of what alienatedme from art but united me with the everyday things in life. Cultured, educatedpeople have a difﬁcult time grasping this in me.—How is it that you, a difﬁcult,sophisticated writer, are bored by Kafka, unimpressed by painting, read cheapnovels?—I have often been asked these questions. Bruno had no trouble at all withthe schoolboy in me (perhaps this was simply because his marvelous intelligenceconceived of me in broader terms).Frustration. False note. Who knows . . . perhaps this appealed to him notonly because he was an enemy of realization on principle. Perhaps it was becausehis capacity for awe hit upon my incapacity for it that our contact turned out to be amutual enrichment from the standpoint of our artistic potentials?
Wednesday
If someone had eavesdropped on our conversations in those, now distant,years, he would have taken us for conspirators. What was the plot? Bruno talked to1961527me about an ‘‘illegal codex’’ and I spoke to him about ‘‘exploding the situation’’ and‘‘compromising form.’’ He told me about ‘‘reality’s sidetrack’’ and I carried onabout a ‘‘liberating cacophony.’’ There was also talk about ‘‘subculture’’ and ‘‘just-short-of-beauties’’ and ‘‘kitsch’’ (which Bruno called ‘‘ersatz’’), etc. What sort oflaboratory was this?In fact we were conspirators. We were consumed with experimenting with acertain explosive material called Form. But this was not form in any ordinarysense—the issue was ‘‘creating form,’’ ‘‘producing it,’’ and ‘‘creating oneself throughthe creation of form.’’ It is hard for me to explain this in a few words; those interestedshould look into our books. I will note only that although each of us begandifferently (for while I wanted to get at myself, and at man in general, through aprovocation of form and its dissonant explosions, Bruno gave himself up to thisalchemy gratis, completely gratis, with the impartiality of a peripheral being), wehad a certain trait in common. We were both utterly alone in confrontation withForm. Bruno the monk without God . . . and I, with my proud humanity, which wasindeed ‘‘alone with itself,’’ supported by nothing, a king of the categorical impera-tive crying in a void: be yourself!These games with form united us, therefore. And it is exactly here that Ihave the suspicion—for experimenters like ourselves, people in a trial stage—thatthe failure in our mutual bond may have been the most felicitous of things. Whatwould have happened if I had responded to admiration with admiration—wouldn’twe have felt too satisﬁed . . . too serious in each other’s eyes? If he had felt my awe, ifI had, in admiring, placed a value on his admiration—wouldn’t this have made ustoo heavy for experimentation . . . with one another? Ah, yes, both he and I soughtadmiration, afﬁrmation . . . because a vacuum wears one down. . . . Would this kindof harmony have been in keeping with our style? Far more in keeping with ourstyle was exactly the bungled reverse of the thing, in which his extended hand didnot meet mine—this typically Schulzian situation, certainly not alien to me either,allowed us at least to preserve the strange freedom of beings not yet born, thepeculiar innocence of embryos—this, therefore, rendered us light in confrontationwith Form.And as for admiration—or lack of it—what did we really care, since both ofus were not real writers.528Volume 3Thursday
Let us not forget to mention the third musketeer. Witkacy. The one arrayedin plumes of a metaphysical dandy, the perpetually removed madman. I did notlike him. He irritated me, and his experiments with form, probably the boldest ofall, were unconvincing to me—they were too intellectual and incapable of movingbeyond a grimace. . . . I felt he lacked talent. And his tricks, the same Dali usestoday to épater, were too classic in their surrealism for my taste.Like King Lear, Witkacy always showed up with a retinue of courtiers andjesters, recruited chieﬂy from among the various literary deformities (like all dicta-tors, he could bear only inferior beings). Upon seeing Schulz or me with themaster, many of these humble acolytes would consider us members of Witkacy’scourt, as no other interpretation would ﬁt into their servile heads—and hence therumor that Schulz and I hail from Witkacy’s school. Nothing doing. Bruno, as Irecall, proﬁted little and regarded him unenthusiastically, and I see no traces ofWitkacy in his work.But we were, nonetheless, a trinity and a fairly characteristic one. Witkie-wicz: intentional afﬁrmation of the madness of ‘‘pure form’’ through vengeance aswell as the fulﬁllment of his tragic destiny, the distraught madman. Schulz: self-destruction in form, the drowned madman. I: burning desire to use form to get atmy ‘‘I’’ and reality, the madman in revolt.
Saturday
I am looking at the pages I wrote about Schulz. Was he really like that? WasI really like that? O real truth, who will sprinkle salt on your tail?As for gratitude . . . I don’t like the feeling . . . not that I am ungrateful bynature but because it is so awkward, does not allow itself to be expressed, and is,therefore, dangerous. How many names, as Shakespeare says, ‘‘should I write inthe book that I read again each day’’! The note in Kultura that I ﬁnally snagged myﬁrst award (Good God!) mentions Wittlin and Sandauer as those who said to mycorpse: rise! But if Jele ´ nski wrote this note, then he forgot to add that all theeditions of my works in other languages should be stamped ‘‘thanks to Jele ´ nski.’’ Sometimes I see nothing but a forest of enemies around me. And some-1961529times, when I look, I spot a benefactor. I am indebted to Litka for Walter Tiel, forexample. And I am indebted to Tiel for the translation of Ferdydurke from Polishinto German, which was greeted with a chorus of praise in the German press—andI am grateful to him for an effort so fervid, unselﬁsh, and scrupulous that right nowpractically all my works have been translated into German and are ready to bepublished. How did I repay Litka for ﬁnding this treasure and forcing him on me? Iwrote: ‘‘It is true that you hit the mark, but as you know, man shoots, God steers thebullet.’’
Sunday
Correspondence. It pains me that I have to refuse Gerda Hagenau ofVienna permission to include my text in an anthology of Polish literature that sheis preparing in Italian for the publisher Feltrinelli.I do this because in this lady’s introduction to her anthology of Polishstories in German entitled Polnisch erzählt, which appeared not long ago, émigréliterature was clearly neglected and writers living in Poland were elevated at theexpense of those in exile. Ignorance? Politics? I don’t know. At any rate, I do notbelieve émigré writers should participate in projects that are sorry grist for thatmill—and what’s even worse, under the guise of ‘‘objectivity.’’
Tuesday
Beduino and I at the bus stop, waiting for bus 208. I say to him: —Hey, oldboy. So as not to be bored in the bus, let’s cut a ﬁne duo. This will get them! Youtalk to me as if I were the conductor of an orchestra and as if you yourself were amusician, ask me about Toscanini. . . .Beduino is game. We board He sits at an appropriate distance and beginsloudly: —If it were me, I’d bring up the double bass, and pay attention, maestro, tothe fugato. . . .People are eavesdropping. I say: Hm, hm . . .He: —And the brass in the passage from fa to re . . . When is your concert?I’ll be playing on the fourteenth. . . . Apropos, when are you going to show meToscanini’s letter?530Volume 3I (loudly): —Young man, you amaze me. . . . I have never known Toscanini,I am not the conductor of an orchestra, and I really don’t understand why you insiston showing off in front of people by pretending to be a musician. Yuk, what sort ofparading around in borrowed plumes is this? It’s not very nice of you!Everyone looks sternly at Beduino. Who turns beet red and shoots me amurderous glance.
Wednesday
What an abundant harvest in the émigré press of intermediaries betweenmy depravity and general virtue. Not long ago I was nothing more than a clownand a pig; today—because of the resonance abroad—various explainers have takento ‘‘objective’’ if sour lecturing on my creations (monsters?) with the expression ‘‘Iwill not praise nor condemn, let the reader draw his own conclusions.’’ Phooey!After such ﬂabby, hopelessly ‘‘objective’’ prose, a man looks for enemies just so hecan breathe the purest, frostiest, mountain air.Another matter: I discover myself in every young author who ﬁghts forhimself.I say this because in Kontynenty Czaykowski demands that I, an old man,read their works—the works of these children who can’t even imagine being thirty.Does he understand what he is saying? Read! Doesn’t he know that even writingmasterpieces is merely a profession—and that art, real art, is to manage to getsomeone to read what you write. It was only in old age that I managed to achievehaving ten or ﬁfteen people read me here and there (and I’m not even sure Imanaged this much). Read?! Ha, ha, I, too, demanded such unreasonable things attheir age.
Thursday
To while away the time, the Anglicist Grabowski is again counting catalogsin which he appears. In a letter—the third in a row, this time to the editors ofKontynenty—he wrote to protest that the decent Mrs. Danilewicz absentmindedlyforgot about him in her lecture on émigré literature. And here is the opinion of thisso-cataloged critical authority on Kajetan Morawski: ‘‘Morawski knows how to1961531write, but he is not a writer!’’ In light of this proclamation Grabowski’s thought hasﬁnally become clear and consistent: a writer is someone who does not know how towrite but who ﬁgures in catalogs.In its own way, the penetrating unself-critical egocentrism of our Anglicist,together with his boring episotolary egotism, is probably not a laudable symptomfrom a social or national point of view. And what would happen if we all beganproclaiming the praise and merits of our Most Honorable navels? It is sad thatthere are so few people who know how to live through others not just throughthemselves. It is really quite easy, Grabowski, all it takes is a little good will.5321962

Wednesday, Hurlingham
I arrived here yesterday at ﬁve in the afternoon, having in my suitcase afew dozen pages of a Cosmos well underway. I am having bad luck with travelinglately. In the train that was already waiting at the Onze station there were novacant seats. I let it leave and waited for another—and I waited for it standingup because the benches were occupied—and while waiting, I watched, with somedistress, the dense, denser and denser, onslaught of people. . . . After a half-hourthe train pulls in, empty as can be and clean as a whistle, the crowd becomesanimated, presses forward, staggers in, I am carried away in the crush, there is noway I am going to get a seat, I am not even standing, I am wedged into place. Thetrain moves.That mug ten centimeters away. The teary, reddish pupils? Little hairs onthis ear? I don’t want this! Away! I will not go on about his chapped skin! By whatright did this ﬁnd itself so close that I practically have to breathe him in, yet at thesame time feel his hot trickles on my ear and neck? We rest our unseeing gazes oneach other from a very near distance . . . each person is curling up, rolling up,shutting, shrinking, limiting to a minimum his eyes, ears, lips, trying to be as littleas possible. Their revolting, fat, veiny, droopy, or dry properties ﬂing me straightinto the air, I feel as if I were leaping straight into the sky—I don’t want this! This isan insult! I am insulted! The train is racing forward and suburban houses ﬂickerby. Station. They push, they push their way in. The train moves.Too much.Joke. Laughter. Someones says: Fidel. Dialogue. I don’t know who is talk-ing to whom but slowly the discussion is settling over us, the same one as always,1962533the one they have learned by heart: imperialism, Cuba, why the government thisand why the government that and order must prevail. Disagreement. Variety ofviewpoints. Meanwhile another twenty people push their way in from the newstation, the voices are becoming more and more hollow, by the time we got close toMorón, one demanded agrarian reform, another the nationalization of industry,the third abolishment of class exploitation, but this gabbing wheezed with theawfulness of crushed rib cages. Lofty thoughts shot straight into the air—could it befrom the pressure of squeezed butts? And one more station and once more thepressing, the discussion wheezes, but it doesn’t stop.Why aren’t they capable of noticing the most important fact—that duringthe discussion more and more people are boarding the train? What sort of unsub-stantiated devil does not allow them to realize the numbers? Tell me, what goodwill your most just systems and the most egalitarian division of property be if in themeantime your neighbor divides herself into twelve, the cretin on the ground ﬂoormakes his old lady into six, and eight are born from two on the ﬁrst ﬂoor? Notcounting the Negroes, Asians, Malays, Arabs, Turks, and Chinese. Or the inhabi-tants of India. What are your speeches if not the blather of idiots, ignorant of thedynamics of their own genitalia?What are they if not the clucking of a hen sitting on an egg—that mostterrifying of bombs?In MorónThe train slowly pulls into the station at Morón, and, having gotten out ofthe mangle, I walk away into space. I go to the square. As often as I come here, Imake a pilgrimage to the square in order to take a look at my past from 1943.But the pizzeria where I shot the breeze is no longer there, nor the caféwhere I played a chess match with the chess master of Morón while dancing theboogie-woogie (we both danced—shufﬂing up to the chessboard when we had tomake a move).Gone as if devoured. And the person searching is no longer the same, alsogone. Poland, my homeland! I have in my pocket a letter from Hollerer invitingme to Berlin and perhaps I might even visit you, Poland, at the same time, to see—but, I ask, who is supposed to look at what? Someone who is not the same atsomething that is no longer what it was? To look from solid ground onto moving534Volume 3water, yes, this can be done. But why should one moving river look at another?Double is the ﬂowing, double the movement and double the noise. . . .Morón, which had formerly been spacious, is now towering, stuffy, urban.Numbers! I go to the bus station, I get in line, a sweetish-sick smell wafts from acorner bar, people before and after me, butt and beak, anemia and lichen, onevendor to another, 175 at 3 percent, woman to woman for 5.30, went up a bit, andsomeone’s pocket radio: ‘‘Get your Tarko detergent now.’’ A little boy makes awisecrack. Sun. Soap. Here we stand in line, and there, on the opposite sidewalk,they walk and walk, pass and pass, without interruption they lick and lick, wherehas all of this come from, why, I am already twenty kilometers outside of BuenosAires! Yet they keep passing and passing, constantly coming from around a cornerand crossing and coming from around the corner and crossing and coming fromaround a corner and crossing and coming from around a corner until I threw up. Ithrew up and the guy that stood in front of me looked and didn’t say much ofanything because what the heck! A crowd.I threw up again and—I am not sure that I am exaggerating—I threw upagain. But what of this again and once more if they are still crossing and stillcrossing, and in Buenos Aires itself there are ﬁve million going to the outhouse ﬁvetimes a day or a total of twenty-ﬁve million every twenty-four hours, I threw up, thebus came and we got on, one after another, and a third after the second and theseventh after the sixth, the driver yawned, took money, handed out tickets, we paidone after another, we move, we are riding, radio, it is getting warm, stuffy, beforeme spills melted butter, spilling for her highness with a gold necklace and an oldman is mumbling something, they push their way in, they ﬁll it up, push out, push,I could have thrown up. . . .Why? Millions! Millions! Millions! How many had thrown up that verymoment in Buenos Aires, how many? Maybe 100 altogether, or 150? Why addmore vomit? What riches! I was a millionaire, everything was multiplying bythousands and millions. The bus stops. I’m supposed to get out here. I get out. I amon the road with a suitcase . . . a scene familiar to everyone? The road is long, carszoom by, I walk away, down a sandy road, breeze, trees, distance, silence.The boredom of nature, grinning like a dog. And the cow of my destinychews away. Slices spaces.1962535QuintaLarge trees, stretched like ﬂags, beneath, a white one-story house and blackshaggy dogs jumping all over me.With Alicja and her husband; I walk in the garden and we say something soas not to be silent.Giangrande, former captain in the Italian Navy, Alicja’s husband, is ab-sorbed with patching the fence so that the puppies don’t get out in the road andsays something only from time to time.It gets dark. We return home. Tea.One goes somewhere, drinks tea, converses, then the opening of the suit-case, arranging things in the guest room . . . isn’t this one of the main activities ofmy life? Listening to new whispers, breathing strange air, deciphering a strangesystem of sounds, smells, lights. When I spoke with them, these details werecrawling all over me, like insects, and made me practically absent.The lamps were on, the dogs lay on the rug.They had bought this quinta [villa] not long ago to get out of the city.Buenos Aires is twenty kilometers from here—at night one can see its pale glow inthe sky, and during the day the air in that direction is dirtier. But between them andBuenos Aires, countless hamlets and small towns almost melting into one another,actually the buildings, the houses know no interruption, the streets, gardens, roads,factories, plants, hamlets, plantations, wires, stations, regions, vegetables, sewagesystems, stores, shacks, kiosks and booths . . . scattered, with greater or lesserdensity, and one would have to walk many hours to the west to hit real ﬁelds.Luckily the trees and shrubs of the quinta are a buffer.At NightMy room is low and elongated, with a large barred window. As always whenI arrived somewhere, I spread my papers on the desk—the started Cosmos —and I looked around, to see where I was. It was almost midnight, they had gone to bedand I was also getting ready to go to sleep. Here I had come to rest in peace and to‘‘recover myself’’ (as Ernesto says) after the hurly-burly of recent days, when I feltsucked into a panicky whirlpool at times. The central avenidas with trafﬁc jams ofscreeching automobiles were still pounding in my ears, the presence of the mon-536Volume 3ster on the horizon was giving me no peace, strange, it bothered me more now thanwhen I was in it.Furthermore, I was bothered by ﬁnding myself tired even here—a peculiarkind of fatigue—the quinta exuded relaxation, and its verdure, its sun, were waterfor thirsty lips, but it was exactly this that brought on the thought about the fatiguethat was seeking relief here.I thought about the alert attitude of the owner of this oasis, Giangrande,who early in the morning, at six, left in his car for a distant factory where he was thedirector and in the course of many hours, in the din and confusion, counted theminutes separating him from a return to peace—except that when he returned inthe evening, the necessity of making the most of every minute of peace took awayhis peace; resting became work, because once again he counted the minutes, thistime separating him from the factory. He was a sculptor in these ‘‘free moments.’’Amid the trees stood his stone busts frozen in line and mass . . . which he sculptedchecking his watch.Sitting on my bed, I thought about the masses and, looking at the things inmy (guest, side) room, I thought about Alicja’s abstract paintings decorating thehall. If not the quinta, then the art was peaceful. Was art peaceful though? Didn’tthe anxiety reach even this ultimate refuge, and not for some inner reason, but as aresult of the very essence of artistic work? Their surrendering themselves to art inthis quinta—this beloved project of theirs—seemed to me to be almost bankruptcyas I spoke with them; there was bitterness not joy in what they said, disappoint-ment, ah, I’m constantly running across signs of this kind of disillusionment in theworld of painters. Painters are depressed by the number of painters. There are toomany. Everyone is painting. This art has become difﬁcult, in our times mediocrityhas triumphed, thanks to which painting has become easy, accessible to students,children, retirees, just step right up, each has been able to ignore all the technicaldifﬁculties, the forms that once barred access to the altar, and today anybody canbe an artist-painter—and, furthermore, these paintings ‘‘are not all that bad.’’‘‘Not all that bad.’’ Her words had all of the inconsolable amazement of aperson unjustly slapped. In assessing my elongated room I thought that this oasiswas ﬁlled with the stone silence of lumps, and with a metaphysics of abstract paint-ings, that it is not at all an oasis and I wondered if I had done the right thing in com-ing here to escape from the monster whose whitish sheen burned on the horizon.1962537The Next MorningI accompany Alicja, who goes to the grocery store to do some shopping—right beyond the quinta begins a mangy meadow, on it small, unﬁnished pro-letarian houses, jutting out as if someone had scattered them over the earth,chaotically, unjoined to themselves or the land. Stones and old bags. Rubble andbrats. Bricks, wheelbarrows, men. Dogs and trash. A radio accompanies the stench,the sun warms up, here and there someone looks at us. . . .To the southeast the dirt in the sky announces Buenos Aires. Could I breakdown and cry? Oh yes, I am merciful enough to sit down on the ﬁrst rock thatcomes along and cry real tears over my own humanity and that of all my brothers—but when I had taken in the ﬁelds of this riffraff, pushing toward us through themeadow, pressing onto us, when I saw how THEY were approaching again, reach-ing again, revulsion and hatred overcame weeping.Birnam wood is marching on you, Macbeth! . . . It wasn’t a wood butgrowing dirt. . . .In the AfternoonShe talked about the consternation of a few of her friends—painters—whohad just returned from a long trip to a few provinces of the ‘‘interior.’’ They said thatin each town one could easily count several dozen painters. ‘‘No one wants to work,everybody wants to be an artist.’’ Whosoever has any life in them, smears canvases!And—unfortunately, yes unfortunately!—‘‘these paintings are not all that bad!’’If only they were bad!But they are not all that bad! A way of seeing and producing has beenformed in the plastic arts thanks to which a completely mediocre person canproduce something not all that bad. What good fortune for those people! If thesmall towns boast several dozen painters, how many could there be in BuenosAires? Twenty thousand? And in Paris?This is what they—she and Giangrande—talked about, as well as aboutother things such as awards, exhibits, art dealers, criticism, concerns, advertising,crazed aesthetes, experts, scientists, dealers—and they weren’t even complaining,merely informing, like people resigned to the fact that an unknown Circe waschanging everything into pigs.What a defeat for the proud art of the Titians! With malevolent satisfaction I538Volume 3took in the decadence of this impure art which was always lewdly tied to the instinctto possess, trade, to expertise and collecting, and perhaps more tied to this than toaesthetic delight. I learned with satisfaction that it had met a fate not much differentthan that meted out to pearls and precious stones when means of mass productionwere found: they became common, they are being killed by market supply!Ha, ha, ha!Am I doing the right thing by laughing right in the faces of paintings,statues?Me?The Next Day, After a WalkThere are streets here that are made of the ivy-covered walls of gardens andgardens—tucked inside are villas. I move along the sand and earth of these streetsnever knowing for sure whether someone is watching me or not, sight could reachme from all sides, the dense foliage is inhabited. At the end of the street the distantsky sags its dark underbelly—torture! What a hullabaloo and rush over there, at thehorizon, what a roar, din, what an anthill of activity, words, and confusion ofevents, combinations and complications, uninterrupted whirlpool . . . that mill,that labyrinth, weighs on me!Quiet and warm. Across from me, down the street, comes a child, a littleboy pushing a bike. A child is marching on you, Macbeth. . . . He comes closerslowly and I, who just yesterday had a face loaded with strange faces, now, thisminute, now break down—and I can ‘‘almost’’ not stand this approaching oneanother, until I ‘‘almost’’ blend in, I ‘‘almost’’ turn sideways, in order to have thiscome out a little gentler. ‘‘Almost’’? The point is (and I have noticed it for a quite awhile) that some sort of theory . . . imposes itself upon me in my relation to people:I know that getting close to someone in an empty place should touch me in myessence powerfully . . . and I try to rouse the right reﬂex in myself. I know, I feel,that the ‘‘how’’ and ‘‘whence’’ and ‘‘why’’ of this other’s ‘‘approaching’’ or ‘‘emerg-ing’’ and what our ‘‘disposition’’ is toward one another should not be a matter ofindifference; I know that it should be more fundamental than one can express inwords; and that it should be ‘‘introductory,’’ or ‘‘preceding’’ my other sensationconstituting something like a background.1962539I try to adjust myself to the theory as if I were declaiming a role.And this lends my actions a half-hearted quality. . . . The oppressive com-plexity on the horizon, heavy and dirty vomit of the sky hanging over the speedingand boiling confusion of this million-strong incomprehensible nightmare.
Saturday
Peekaboo, peekaboo, our servant Helena is really a cuckoo! So chirrup,chirrup and tweet, tweet, tweet! Cock-a-doodle-doo!That was the orchestration . . . and now the plot.Right after I got here I noticed that something was not quite right withHelena. Neat, polite, but when she serves the soup one has the impression that shecould very well be doing something quite different, such as bursting into song. Sheis like a tightrope walker, ﬁnding her balance over the abyss ‘‘of something else’’and ‘‘anything at all else.’’She was diagnosed as undoubtedly crazy by the psychiatrist to whom shewas sent for a checkup. —Sometimes she has attacks—says Alicja—and then shemakes scenes, but it passes. Worse yet is that the doctor says she is dangerous: oneof these days she could have a real attack and grab a knife. . . .—And you afraid to be around her—I mean Cio (Giangrande) spends somuch time out of the house, and then you are all alone. . . .—What am I supposed to do? Send her packing? Who’ll hire a nut? Andher daughter? What would I do with the child? Should I send her to the hospital?She’s not crazy enough and it would be inhuman to lock someone like her up in anasylum. . . . Those places are overcrowded, it’s hell in there. . . .Peekaboo, peekaboo, she’s really cuckoo, I stepped onto the road fromwhere I could see in the aforementioned direction the darkening sky boding. . . . Iwent home, defended by trees, brush, enclosure, greenery, bars in the windows,statues, paintings, but tainted now . . . where paranoia bustled among the pots andpans. . . . It was quiet, Alicja was sleeping, echoes came from the kitchen, the dogswere sleeping, I felt surprised, disconcerted, I felt that I should come up withsomething but I didn’t know what, with some . . . First of all, I didn’t know what sortof burden I was carrying. Was I heavy? Or light?540Volume 3Sunday
Democritus . . . How many? We write:
Democritus, 400,000St. Francis of Assisi, 50,000,000Ko´sciuszko, 500,000,000Brahms, 1,000,000,000Gombrowicz, 2,500,000,000
The numbers next to the name are supposed to indicate the ‘‘humanhorizon’’ of a given man, that is, how he imagined, more or less, the number ofpeople in his time—how he felt as ‘‘one of many.’’ Of how many? I am jotting thenumbers down haphazardly . . . but I believe that one should supply ﬁgures for thenames so that not just the name be known, but its ‘‘place among people.’’This is the ‘‘singular’’ of a man, this is his ‘‘number.’’ Will I be understood?What I am saying is that, until now, man has never taken up the problem of hisnumbers. The numbers have not permeated him sufﬁciently. I am a man—yes. Butone of many. Of how many? If I am one of two billion it is not the same as if I wereone of two hundred thousand.In us lives Adam’s lone sense of himself. Our philosophy is a philosophy ofAdams. Our art is the art of Adams. Two things astound me when I consider howman has expressed himself in art until now: that his expression did not break intotwo phases, the two phases of his life, the ascending (youth) and the descending;and that this expression was inadequately saturated with numbers.You will say: in how many novels, ﬁlms, poems, symphonies and evenpaintings there appears the human element—the masses. The epic! Yes, this hap-pens in art, nor is it unknown to sociology, psychology, but this is a descriptionachieved from the outside—one describes the human herd as one does any otherherd. It is not enough for me that Homer or Zola will sing the praises of anddescribe the masses; nor that Marx analyzes them; I would like for something toappear in their voices which would allow me to know that one was one of athousand and the other, one of a million. I would like to see them permeated to thecore by numbers.I am writing all this because of the servant Helena. It is growing dark and I1962541turn on the lamp on my little desk, inhale the damp air pulsating from the garden (itrained all morning). What is Helena up to? In the kitchen? Yes, in the kitchen. Andthe thing on the horizon? Yes, it most certainly is there, glowing. . . . And the tinyhouses creeping up on the mangy meadow? Yes. The paintings and statues? Yes, onthe walls, in the garden . . . Look, will you, at how many elements of compositionyou have in hand, begging to be given an artistic setting—but why can’t I composemyself? I collapsed—an impotent at the desk—I drooped: the horn doesn’t work, theﬂute is broken, I cannot draw a single note. I lack direction, I don’t know whichdirection to speak to, I can’t, I lack the direction that precedes the voice.Conﬁrm in yourself once more: you are tormented more by not knowingwhat to do with yourself when faced with human unhappiness than you are bysomeone else’s unhappiness. The paranoia in her messed-up head—in her igno-rant head—I might be able to endure it if I knew whether or not I was allowed touse the word ‘‘head.’’Who is she? And how can I know who I am if I don’t know who she is? Isshe one more piece of baggage added to the heaps of women already on the earth,another cow? O Eve the only! Here at my desk, I am extending all my love and allmy—what shall I call it—sublimity, I, Adam, for you to become an Eve to me, butsomething is creeping into my parade . . . of a billion devils! a billion cows! amillion women! and when I realize the numbers, I plummet into strange states ofmind, amid which the states of revulsion and recoil are not at all ﬁrst. And theOlympian indifference that results from the interchangeability of one woman foranother and one paranoia for another paranoia? And add to this boredom. . . .I repeated out loud: ‘‘I am bored by suffering in such quantities,’’ and Ilistened to the strange, even odd, but so much my own (and human) content ofthese words.And believe it or not but my soul makes me laugh, my spirit, just one of somany. If I do not pity the servant Helena, then who will pity the servant Helena?Pity has multiplied too—in Buenos Aires alone there are about a hundred thou-sand spirits that one could term spiritualized. This makes me laugh. . . .I repeat out loud, ‘‘pity in such quantities makes me laugh,’’ and I listen tothe peculiar, unusually human, content of this.I get up. I leave. From the road I see rising on the horizon into thedescending night a whitish, electric fog, practically elusive but tormenting, com-542Volume 3plicated, as if unreal . . . the awful fact that is crushing me . . . trampling me intothe ground. . . .

‘‘Except for: did his fears and worries . . . really exist. —Some sort of theory—writes Gombrowicz—imposes itself upon me in relation to people . . . Andwasn’t that problem of numbers also an imagined one, drawn from a theory thattold him to accept the notion that numbers reach us in our humanity?‘‘Gombrowicz understood that his ﬁrst responsibility would be to deter-mine how attainable this was. But . . . is it worth determining? And why reallybother?‘‘For even if he doesn’t ﬁgure it out, others will do it for him, how manyhundreds of thousands of heads there are to rack their brains over the problem!‘‘And this is why instead of spending a sleepless night, he went straightto bed.’’

Tuesday, Buenos Aires
I was returning from Hurlingham at night, by car, the trip was endless, thelights obtrusive and blinding, the speeding shooting masses skidding out from thedense growth of houses and lamps descending upon us, and radio towers, and thelargeness of lone buildings and clattering trains—we were caught in a net ofdesperate, unconscious movement. I sat quietly in the comfortable cavity of thecar. Suddenly we slow down, turn into a side street, stop—what’s this?—EngineerOrlov, our driver, says in a barely audible voice that he must rest a moment . . . hehardly has enough time to apologize when he falls asleep at the steering wheel.Consternation.In a few minutes he wakes up and we’re driving again, although moreslowly. —Please do not be worried. . . . Nothing is wrong. . . . I have to drink somecoffee. We drive up to a corner bar that is the quintessence of sleep, the moso wasdozing, a few coffee and grappa drinkers were also dozing, the empty tables, chairs,1962543windows, walls, were sleeping, the head of space itself was nodding, overcome by alittle sleep—and on the outside vehicles were tearing by one after another—andthis mixture of speed and sleepiness . . . was it sleepy speed or speeding sleep? . . .Coming HomeMy apartment was so loaded with sleep—I had to pass by ﬁve doors behindwhich so much sleep was concentrated, ﬁrst Roberto’s (Argentine, a student) andHerr Klug’s (a merchant); then don Eugenio’s, who is Russian and works in theport; Basilio’s, who is Rumanian; and Arana’s, Argentine, a bureaucrat. They aresleeping or they are not. One has to move carefully amid this density and respectrest, which is alien to me. . . . Here nothing and no one is familiar to me, myconversations with them boil down to que tal? and tiempo loco; the old man whountil recently lived in Arana’s room stopped me once to ask if I didn’t want to buyhis brass bed and a week later he died.Our discretion is ﬂawless, there is no way anyone is going to blurt it all outtearfully, howl or roar, sometimes it is only at night that the ghost of someone’sgroan rises and circles the working of the lungs. Each consumes his life like a bigsteak on a separate plate at a separate table. Would I be reckless not to lock myselfin at night? Who will guarantee that crime will not be born in this confusion offates? No. The repellent discretion has arisen from the sense that one person isrepugnant to another, boredom and pain, this timidity enjoins one to avoid inti-macy, it protects me better than an English keep. I can sleep peacefully. They willnot kill me. They will be too afraid to approach me.
The Next Day
My God, what kind of inﬁnity is it that you are proposing? I would describeit as ‘‘internal,’’ contained in our own bosom.It is certainly strange that we cannot exhaust our species, that I will neverbe able to get to know all the people there are (nor am I anywhere close), that I willnot be able to say: this is it, I have seen them all, there are no more.To constantly meet a new variety of man, with a different humanity ineach, and to know that there is no end to these variations—and that we are loadedwith the inﬁnity of other possible combinations—and that there is no man who is544Volume 3impossible in the near or distant future . . . what an inner abyss! This leads to alawlessness of the imagination!This destroys all psychological, moral and other norms, one has the feelingthat we are being exploded, not in the least by the spirit but by the connivance ofcopulating bodies creating variants.
Thursday
The last business before departure—tomorrow—with Gomez to Uruguay. Ipull out my suitcase.
Friday
Airplane. Azure. Altitude 1,500—what a joke! Someone’s joke on me.But really amusing (and it is with difﬁculty that I keep from laughing), thatbesides me there are forty-nine others, just like me, rocking in space. We aregliding in a group. This number in the air is different than the earthly one andmakes me giddy.Next to me is my traveling companion, J. C. Gomez.Down below a lichen of ﬁve million people is growing smaller at a speed ofﬁve hundred (per hour).
Saturday, Piriapolis
Two hundred and ten kilometers, ﬁfty passengers, two hundred and tenkilometers traveled in twenty-ﬁve minutes, but the ﬁfty took almost one hun-dred and eight minutes, or three hours (inspection of suitcases, documents), fromwhich I conclude that the number of passengers was greater by one hundred andﬁfty-ﬁve, in the difﬁculties that had to be overcome, than the number of kilome-ters. Gomez approves of this reckoning, supplementing it with reﬂections on thesubject of ‘‘the phenomenon of numbers and numbers of the phenomenon’’—thiswas when we were leaving customs in the Uruguayan capital—although it seemedto me that he was talking earlier, too, throughout the entire ﬂight, except that thepropellers were making too much of a racket.1962545We get to the bus that is supposed to take us to Piriapolis, I poke him withmy elbow because in front of us is a leaky bundle, yes, the bundle of the person infront of us was leaking and it was vodka, the smell said vodka! I almost fell overbecause I was still feeling a bit unsteady on my feet after that altitude and thatvodka dripping from the bundle (ﬁlled with vodka?) right on the other side ofcustoms was vodka even more, this was a so-called fortiﬁed vodka . . . and the shockof this confused my friend, he actually had to leap out of the moving bus, becausehis hand luggage had gotten lost somewhere and this resulted in a solitary ride toPiriapolis (at four in the afternoon).I settled down in my little room, in the Villa Los Angeles, waiting forGomez to arrive on the next bus.The building was hidden in a pine forest and hollow as a stump, frozen in aGothic perspective of trees and no people, where garlands of male and femalewashing, as well as linens made up the moment, after that recent tussle—I assumethat this will not be very clear—of debilitating human numbers, its substitute, oreven decadence . . . this was the pale specter of a crowd something like themoon . . . and like illness . . . I breathed deeply. Calm. Quiet. When will Gomezshow up? Ah, and that bundle, how that smuggled liquid dripping out, forbidden,the drops glittering in the sun illegally. . . .
The Next Day, Piriapolis
Oh, how relaxation intoxicates!
Sunday
Indefatigable alcohol pokes me with its elbow in the immediate vicinity.
The Next Day
The landscape has penetrated my bones. A bottle but not that one, togetherwith three others, in the cabinet, in a corner room with a veranda, looking out ontothe road.546Volume 3Tuesday
The rustle of almighty silence . . . but is it sleep inducing?
Wednesday
Should I be a joker?Oh no . . . It doesn’t suit me. You aren’t expecting this! I am not one toamuse with jokes.But what can you do if the Joke lies in ambush, on all sides, if you aresurrounded by the Joke?
Thursday, before Going to Sleep
I am inhaling the soaring greenbrown lack of people with a moon—thishouse is sly, because on our side, mine and Gomez’s, there is not a living soul, nohuman intrusion, but on the other side it is stuffed like a liver sausage, two peopleper cubicle—but nobody know this, no noise reaches us on this side . . . and theyhave different paths, invisible to us, through the woods.Today a morning discussion with Gomez about the modern forms of afﬁr-mation and about our relationship to it (this is the negation of negation, he said); adifferent, afternoon, one, bordering on hermeticism; and an evening one with ‘‘pi’’as a symbol, which would lend itself to grasping all that ‘‘goes by,’’ including thatwhich is the ultimate secret of art. He likes this. He calls himself: chatterbox.Yesterday he talked about how his pals at school would say cierra la canilla! (shutoff the faucet) and when this did not help, they put a wash basin or some othercontainer in front of him. . . .We eat on the veranda, carrying on. Our food is brought to us by an eight-year-old girl, the only representative of them from the other side of the building,and what satisfaction that they over there appear to us in weakened form, reduced tosomething less than ten years old. We know who is cooped up over there on thatside, we make the acquaintance of Diputado and his señora, Helman and Ricardo,as well as the crazy Andaluz, also an escriba, and his family, we know something1962547about the overcrowding in those cubicles, but on this side a wooded expanse andonly that laundry hanging on the line, shirts in various sizes, underpants, towels. . . .It moves, caressed by a breeze. . . . I would prefer not to have to deal withthis degraded presence, with this calling card of a kind, smacking of mockery. . . .
And some are yet ungotten and unbornThat shall have cause to curse the Dauphin’s scorn.
O Shakespeare! Except that in this case the joke itself is unborn. Perhaps Iam drawing from the visible circumstances of our stay the detached fact of the—uncrystallized—joke oozing from the crevices, but ungracefully . . . clumsily . . .The question why is this comical, do we look comical in all this, remains hanging(and, if I were tipsy, I would add, ‘‘hanging like those shirts and underpants’’).(It never occurred to me that he had this habit and I had no idea that suchan elaboration was taking place in him).Chissotti. Nuts.
Friday
Oh, what a brilliant and generous feature of literature: this freedom tomake up stories, exactly as if we were choosing different paths in a forest, neverknowing where they might lead—or what awaits us. . . .
Friday
Around eight o’clock there is a breakthrough: for at this hour I emerge fromisolation and enter the ‘‘city’’ made up of two parallel streets, thirty hotels, andtwenty stores, but a city all the same, with asphalt and neon.I go in order to eat supper in the restaurant at the Hotel Rivadavia. Mylearned friend appears. The dining hall is full, but the number is weakened,dusky. . . .We sit down. . . .Even before the moso brought hors d’oeuvres and a carafe, a dialogue getsgoing about Proust’s lack of brilliance or about the naïveté of perversion or about548Volume 3‘‘dry’’ and ‘‘clammy’’ tragedy. We get warmed up, our eyes shine, we raise a hand,we say permiso in order to have our say and we enter such labyrinths that really (Isay) one no longer knows what one is eating. Nor what one is drinking. And aglaring contrast is being born between our table and the remaining ones, wherepeople drone on in fumes of boredom. A mother is scolding her children. Fathersare muttering something almost equine, with newspaper or without. The ﬁancéwill say something stupid to his ﬁancée. Then they stare at us . . . they would like tounderstand something or other. . . .Gomez raised a glass of Curaçao to his lips. He conﬁdes in me with a smilethat until now he has never met anyone in Piriapolis who discusses things . . . weare the only ones. . . .Returning home we had quite an energetic discussion on the subject of‘‘ex,’’ that persistent idea (ex-istir) invading various areas, and its connections withtransitoriness. He cited Siegrist and his opinions about the maniacal nature ofphysics. I, on the other hand, reminded him of Siegrist’s sighing, ‘‘The stocksare falling!’’
Sunday
Our trips to higher and higher peaks, wading in thickets that take your sightaway, scaling rocky walls and being suspended over dizzying precipices just to haveunencompassable, immeasurable spaces unfold before us and melt into fog.Excursions—tramping through dense woodland that leads to blindness,confusion, dizziness—scaling crags and clinging to rock faces with bare hands in avertiginous climb in order to have unbounded spaces unfold before us, lulled tosleep by the fog. We take along food and drink for three days.Intellectual excursions, of course.
Sunday (Late at Night)

The next afternoon(I am writing this in my room)
I could jot down today that ‘‘I feel awful’’ and this might be the joke I fearmost of all.Helman was here a moment ago. He supposedly came to see Gomez(whom he did not ﬁnd at home) in order to take care of some small bills.At any rate, this was the ﬁrst visit from ‘‘that side’’ and I would not bet twocents that his behavior was completely laundered of all joking intentions. . . .Malicious?Joke? Oh, if in the end this vapor of a joke, steaming elusively . . . To ﬁnallycatch sight of the monster meandering drowsily among the trees, behind thehouse, along the crest of the mountains and the ocean horizon. . . . Well then,monster, show yourself! What’s it all about? What do you want from me! Showyourself!Nothing.At breakfast, a lengthy exchange of opinion that began quite accidentallyfrom the quadruple root of sufﬁcient reason but immediately passed into the ‘‘basisof corporeality’’ as introduced by the Renaissance and changing itself currentlyinto the ‘‘basis of compromise,’’ which in the future could become (as I claimed)the ‘‘basis of passion.’’ A woman with two children stopped on her way to pick up afew of our violent words—but she caught nothing. She left.550Volume 3Tuesday
Laziness . . . I could not guarantee that laziness was not what was happen-ing to us . . . before the lazy mountains, glassy sea, the few ants moving about and(why should I hide this?) that which is hanging on the line . . . and sagging. . . .Laziness . . . Laziness . . .How pleasant: it is good not to know—to allow it to speak for itself—to listento one’s own words . . .Ahhhhh!Sleep.The Same Day at NightBe quiet! Be quiet!It probably slipped by. . . . Who? The Joke!Calm down!I have the feeling that he appeared to me at twilight, where, sitting on theveranda, I was looking at . . . why shouldn’t I admit it . . . the laundry, which at thishour seemed a poisoned, ruined ﬂag, cadaver pale and moonlit. This was THEIRﬂag, from over there, from that side, ha, this was they, they themselves, I saw themhanging in a row on a rope: Diputado and the señora, Helman and Ricardo andAndaluz and little Celia and the notary public’s family. . . . I saw them but in theform of underpants, shirts, a debased and sneering reﬂection of the real existenceon that side.And here the Joke peeped out, grinning. . . .For—I understood—that side was a trick! A joke! Because that side —for them—is on our side!So then it was not a reﬂection . . . it was they, on those clotheslines, in theirnatural form!Wise guys!Joke, or only the possibility of a joke? I do not want to talk to Gomez aboutthis. I have already talked to Gomez too much. I will not talk to Gomez anymore.Enough gabbing with Gomez. I only want to write down, just in case, that Ipersonally have had no hand in any sort of joke. . . .No.1962551I know that if I answer joke for joke, I am lost. I must maintain, even now,the seriousness of my existence.Wise guys! If I am to be comical, then only on the outside, not internally—let this comicality be like an approaching cloud, a thickening fog, a rustle inthe underbrush, an insinuation on the horizon; let it seep secretly from the out-side, let it seep through, approach my center from all sides, from all direc-tions, I will remain unyielding, like Tell with the apple . . . of gravity . . . onmy head. . . .Sapienti sat!
Wednesday, the Third
Here it ends. I left Piriapolis on 31 January via Colonia and I arrived inBuenos Aires the same day at 11:30 p.m.Gomez left before me, summoned by a telegram from someone at theuniversity.So I will never know what really happened to us in Piriapolis.Coming HomeThe apartment was loaded with sleep when after midnight, my head stillswimming from the dancing of the boat on the waters of La Plata, I sneaked intomy room with my suitcase. Roberto, Herr Klug, don Eugenio, Basilio, Arana, weresleeping—sighing and groaning phantoms rose above the work of their lungs. Whatare numbers in sleep? Sleeping numbers? Are you sleeping, numbers? Or don’tyou ever sleep?No—our numbers do not fall asleep with us, how could sleep overcome acreature made of adding and subtracting . . . it circles tirelessly. . . . I kept askingmyself, in my room, sitting on the bed, if the fact that there were many sleepingpeople (ﬁve) was a soothing or disturbing fact? Is the sleep of one person moredangerous than that of a few, a few dozen or a few hundred? Ah, hm, a pretentiousquestion . . . but not without its sting. Numbers in relation to man—allow me toobserve—act astonishingly, as they multiply and divide at the same time. Who candoubt that the activity of ﬁve people pulling on a rope will be ﬁve times moreproductive than if only one does it? But with death it is quite the reverse. Try killing552Volume 3a thousand people at one time and you will be convinced that the death of each ofthese is less important than if each had died alone.Thus it was a soothing thought—that they slept, dreamed, ﬁve at a time—and I could place my head on my pillow quietly and join them as number six intheir heavy, greedy, meandering breathing. What harm could the night or sleepdo me while benevolent Numbers watched over me, diluting me in themselves.Like a fairy godmother! Like a guardian angel! Good night! Time to end theseconfessions . . . is everything clear? A bit muddled? Something a little dissolute,unsteady, diffuse, licentious . . . di . . . diluted? Friends! What do you want? Even ifthere were some sort of intellectual debauchery here, Numbers will dilute it inthemselves, just as they dilute our sins and virtues, amen.

The same and nothing but more of the same!I was at a boxing match with Quiloﬂoro, bam, bam, bam, they punch oneanother, the public roars, the referee dances. It was clear that this was a match buteven so I couldn’t be sure it wasn’t a funeral.With ´Swieczewski at the Georges Pretre concert. Yet if someone had toldme that this was a suburban beach on a scorching day, I could not have contra-dicted him. Or maybe—a bus?Eichler’s show. Grocholski’s show. Yes, but what is it about them thatsmells ﬁve o’clock-ish?Five o’clock.* A funeral rather, because at the cemetery, and it was raining,umbrellas, raincoats with collars up, speeches, hats. A funeral? Well, to a degree.Why not a wedding? . . . A tram?Supper at the Plaza, tables, footmen, chandelier, hors d’oeuvres, jokes,except for the question: funeral—beach—wedding—boxing match—tram?I know you, O force, reducing everything to a common denominator. Iknow you basso ostinato in the lowest register of existence. I hear your relentless
*Italicized words in English in original.1962553step. I see you, Numbers, blurring everything, melting everything, how you sproutfrom a woman’s belly!
Tuesday
I saw Stanis™aw Wis™ocki—the conductor of the Warsaw Philharmonic whohas come to make guest appearances—a few times, the conversation was almostexclusively about music. A little present from him—how lovely on his part—aPolish recording of the Brahms Concerto in D Minor in which he conducts thePhilharmonic orchestra and Ma™cu˙zy ´ nski.*The virtuosi are still holding together, as their contact with music is frag-mentary; it takes place through works that they ‘‘have at their ﬁngertips,’’ not many,therefore, and usually not the latest. A pianist or violinist, even if he carries withinhimself the artistic dignity of a Backhaus, is close to his craft and this preserves himfrom excessive spiritual poisoning. But where music takes on a creative characterand reveals itself completely, a pale terror reigns. A modern composer deals with ahostile, many-layered, even fuming element that is like a bird raising itself abovethe ﬂood with the last remnants of its strength. Stagnation and inundation. Theconductors who must channel this element are no less stupeﬁed. The Polishconductors also radiate panic—I am speaking of the ones I have met in Argentina(Skrowaczewski, Panufnik, and now Wis™ocki).As long as it is a matter of things professional and of rivalry in the greatinternational contest, who is better, who worse, will Poland stand a chance, etc.,etc.—it isn’t so bad. But the minute one pushes the musician up against a wall, thatis, up against music, pure music, music alone, he begins to bang his head againstthat wall. In his voice one hears the helplessness of someone who is drifting calmlydown a river when his river suddenly stops, having struck underwater reefs, andnow he doesn’t know what to do with the stirred and spilled mass, gushing in alldirections, in unending movement, yet immobile. . . .It is easier to see all the time that musicians are no longer ‘‘able to stand’’music (just as painters cannot stand painting).It is true that their situation in history was never, from a social standpoint,
†Witold Ma™cu˙zy ´nski, noted Polish pianist.554Volume 3normal or completely honest. If one considers that a person with a fairly trained earis unable to recognize even a work with a classically lucid structure, like a sonata,unless he listens to it at least ﬁve times, then the public intimacy with music inconcert halls will seem almost exclusively humbug and a putting on of the guests. Iask myself many times, in leaving a concert hall, what those impassioned ap-plauders could have grasped if I, a little brighter perhaps in these matters with botheye and spirit, came out with nothing more than a mishmash. Therefore, theseconcert sessions, which have gone on successfully for centuries, are testimony thatthe majestic social role of music has little to do with . . . listening.Nonetheless this inborn, let us say, original sin of music, which in Handeland Haydn’s day was only a sin, today festers like an enormous, venom-ﬁlled boil.That mill, thousands of orchestra halls, throngs of listeners, hosts of virtuosi likebolides ﬂying between the continents, academic convocations, festivals, contests,armies of technicians, theoreticians, engineers, writers, critics, stacks of books . . .and this whole racket taking place as if behind glass, inaccessible, unknown,unrealized in people. Scandal! Silliness! Shame on a large scale! O woman! If onlyyou knew what horrors you cause with your procreation you would be morecareful!But if someone was cheered by the thought that the scandal caused bynumbers is limited to the social role of music, one has to enlighten him. No, thewriting on the forehead of modern man that marks him ‘‘as one of many’’ touchesus even at the highest peaks, where, it would seem, there are no crowds. You didnot conﬁne yourself, O woman, to procreating listeners. You procreated creators aswell! In Bach’s day there were fewer organists than there are Bachs today—andwith ambitions greater than Johann Sebastian’s! Someone talked with Wis™ockiabout the talented Argentinean Ginastera—Oh, he’s a marvelous musician, I amtaking his suite to Warsaw.—What place would you give him on a world scale?—Ithink you could list him as one of the top hundred composers.But if anyone has nurtured the illusion that the indefatigable fecundity ofwoman, in surrendering man to Numbers, leaves his work alone—that is, that areally outstanding work endures in its majesty despite the number of recipients andthe number of creators—let him know that he is mistaken. The work most ob-viously has a negative attitude toward pregnancy: musical works have becomereluctant, even malicious today—they become a bone stuck in your throat, they1962555stiﬂe you, choke you. Others get restive like wild donkeys and kick and bite. Bachwas one, but the catalog of his works includes hundreds of works, he spawnedeasily in the highest style. Today there are more composers than there are works byBach, but all of them together have probably not given birth to ten partitas solidlygrounded in the Spirit. Today’s work does not want to be born (as if to avenge itselfon woman), the idea devours more and more efforts, ‘‘pulling up to a certainlevel,’’ the composing of humble works stretches across years, when the composerreaches his opus no. 20 he says, ‘‘ugh!’’ as if he were scaling a skyscraping moun-tain. Also worth noting is that the malice of a musical work is the reverse of the onethat a painting gives off: in painting, disqualiﬁcation follows the ease of procrea-tion, which passes into one giant miscarriage. A certain popular painter (whowould remember his name?), after arriving in Buenos Aires one morning, paintedin the course of one day at least twenty scenes to ﬁll up the exhibit space, rented thefollowing day. . . . And he sold the paintings, making a bundle.How is it with this procreation? Does the procreation of a woman take awayfrom the procreation of the Spirit? I return to the question: is there a connectionbetween number and personality, some deadly link?I hold it against Wis™ocki that he did not get drunk. I thought that he wouldbe more consistent (I was told about a group of eminent musicians who gatheredweekly for conversations about music and who, after half an hour, crazed looking,pale, and sweaty browed, drowned their hopelessness and defeat in vodka). ButWis™ocki drank little and was never in a bad mood—how unfair of him.
BBB
I am noting in the margin so as not to forget: if you want to astonish amusician and throw him off balance so he cannot utter a word—attack Bach! Itseems as if this is still left to them: Bach. Naturally one must ﬁrst show that one isno ignoramus—and then attack, out of the blue!
Wednesday(How These Days of the Week Already Bore Me!)
The sense of undeserved hurt and grievous offense are prominent here,as well as in painting, where these people do not know what is happening to556Volume 3them, except to say something is happening. Simply: Form has gone mad, rousedby Numbers.Wis™ocki reminded me of Skrowaczewski, or rather the situation in which Ifound myself with Skrowaczewski when he invited me to supper, a year or two ago.We are walking down Corrientes, we go from restaurant to restaurant, full, over-ﬂowing, the street is ﬁling up, the cinemas are spewing out. . . . A conversation(about music) is a shout from a great distance, as if we were talking long-distanceon the telephone.Numbers, this is the kingdom of mathematics. And mathematics is sci-ence. . . . That poor X, a young man who wanted to sing his heart out, fullof enthusiasm—gets busy studying, bold, diligent, capable of great self-sacriﬁce,wants to possess the language of tones . . . until he begins to notice that somethingawful is coming from all this, for the mathematics hidden in music, and in itselfquite poisonous to the spirit, surrenders to the increase and doubling resultingfrom the invasion of a different mathematics, connected to the numbers . . . ofworks, concerts, formulas, theories, styles, schools, instruments . . . and with thenumbers of people. . . . Accursed belly of woman! What was he to do? Slowly,almost imperceptibly, he became a sound engineer instead of an artist, a scientiﬁcproducer of art.
Thursday
I, if I touch upon the crisis in art, do not do so because I overestimate it, Imyself being an artist—but it does express a universal crisis in human form. . . .Georges Girreferèst-Prést ﬂew in from Paris. Spent yesterday with him inFragata. . . . Coffee. Cognac.He told me what other people told him . . . gleanings of rumors and oldgossip from the immediate postwar period . . . it is difﬁcult to check and God onlyknows what really went on . . . but it does throw a beam of strange light on thehistory of Sartre’s thought. . . .It is interesting how much this adventure of Sartre’s reminds me of some-thing that happened to Skrowaczewski and me: crowds, anthills, throngs (this isnot the ﬁrst time that anecdotes add up like this). Anyway, Sartre, still young then,1962557was taking a stroll down l’avenue de l’Opéra at seven in the evening, at a time whenthe trafﬁc was heaviest. It was especially hideous (as he confessed to friends later)when we experience man a short distance away as an almost physical threat, yet if,at the same time, he is dehumanized by the mass, he is only the thousandthrepetition of a man, a duplicate, an example, almost a monkey; when he is,therefore, simultaneously, because of the numbers, very close and awfully far.Having found himself in this throng-crush, people-nonpeople, our still youngnonauthor of Being and Nothingness takes to summoning loneliness with hiswhole soul: Oh! To stand out! Be apart! Break away! Escape! But people werestepping on his feet. . . .Finally he ran away—Gifferèst droned on—into himself! Into the unity ofhis own consciousness and into the concreteness of his own existence. This was akind of double wall, with which he hermetically sealed himself off from others.Having slammed the doors of his ‘‘I’’ after him! (From what Prést said, it wouldseem that the double-tracked isolation of Sartre’s existentialism began in a crowd!)But this is not all. Apparently (according to Gifﬂè-Prést’s version) the radi-cal idea of isolation was not happy with being isolated in his being for very long.For something indecent happened, which Sartre later remembered reluctantly—namely, that as soon as the idea of isolation came to live in him, he immediatelynoticed, in his peripheral vision, that it would ﬁnd a glad response in those thou-sands of souls threatened by numbers, the numbers still seemed to be ﬁxed to anidea that derived from it and was tied to it antinomically. And it was exactly thefeeling that his thought about isolation could be accepted by many that inclinedhim to devote more time to it. In vain did he fend off this confusion of philosophywith numbers, showing himself in black and white that neither Consciousness northe Concrete has the right to grow fat on such yeast. In spite of everything, they didgrow fat. They grew. Until he ﬁnally undertook a systematic elaboration and,leaning on many philosophers from the past, began to work out his own system,which in its original phase merely pronounced that I am I, not Peter or Paul. I amexclusively myself in a way that is absolute and impenetrable to others, like a can ofsardines. And, after all, there are no others!But it does not end here, though. Suddenly, Sartre is horriﬁed by thethought: —What? I am alone. I have discovered that no one has access to me!558Volume 3I have cast off classical philosophy because it was too social, too communicativein its abstract logic; I have locked myself in myself, I—the impenetrable, sin-gular in my consciousness! I have destroyed the Other! I have annihilated allother people!Let us agree that the thought of isolation fattened by numbers can terrify—such a creature does not go on foot. The worst (still Giffelèr Pretét’s version): thatthis fear was also not alone. It immediately became magniﬁed by the numbers ofall those others whom he could share himself with—and the burning of a treebecame the conﬂagration of an entire forest in our philosopher.In vain does Sartre turn to self-persuasion: —Why, in being the Only One Icannot be one of Many! . . . All for naught. Can’t manage it. In not being able tomanage this thought, he decides to undo what he has done. —Have I destroyed theOther? Then I have to rediscover him, reinstitute, recognize, reestablish my bondwith him!He proceeds to elaborate. He draws out the Other . . . ha, I am no longeralone, I have already felt his glance on me, victory! Victory?What are you talking about! The thing gets complicated. The matter be-comes altogether unpleasant.—But what happened?—I asked Prevèst. To which he replied: —So, yousee, the Other one, now reinstituted and called into being, had nothing in com-mon with the concrete man. It is not Peter, not Paul, it is someone else. TheObject to which I attribute the character of the Subject, whose freedom I recog-nized. You say this is nothing awful? But you should note that now our philosopherhas found himself face-to-face with full numbers—of all possible people—of manin general. He who took fright at the Parisian mob now saw himself facing all mobs,all individuals, everywhere and always.—I made his acquaintance during this exact period—droned Giffèleré,sipping a liqueur.—This was already after the publication of Being and Nothingness. Theenormity of the confrontation crushed him: he vs. everyone else. But in spite of thehorrifying panorama, he did not give up and with unyielding consistency pro-claimed his slogans: responsibility for everyone, union with everyone. And hemight have made it even though he took humanity onto his shoulders . . . if not for1962559this, if not for the fact that numbers had again mixed into the whole, includingeveryone, overﬂowing in a way that was really indecent . . . the number of copies ofhis work . . . the number of editions . . . the number of readers . . . the number ofcommentaries . . . the number of thoughts that hatched out of his thoughts and thenumber of thoughts hatching out of these thoughts . . . and the number of all thedifferent variants of these variants. . . . The amount is unbearable in this, overﬂow-ing, as it is supernumerary. . . . This was Everyone plus Numbers.Then I saw (these are still Prêst’s words) him write when he got close to adamp window.
nec hercules contra plures
And he was close to suicide. For how could he retreat or ﬂee when a million peoplewere reading him and new editions were constantly going out into the world? Oh,not Everyone horriﬁed him but the fact that there were so many of Everyone!Death then? He tries to commit suicide. But, after a moment, he gives it up.Because, when he thinks about it, things are not so bad. It is true that his bank-ruptcy is awful and his catastrophe terrible. But catastrophe dissolves in millions.Caused by numbers it comes to nothing as a result of these same numbers, in thetopsy-turvy and hurly-burly, when no one knows anything, no one understandsanything, people talk but no one knows what about, one about this, another aboutthat, and somehow nothing comes of it. . . .
nec hercules contra plures
Saturday(in the Café at the Corner of Maipu and Laval; Rain)
The numbers have bored me stiff. . . .I look at the issue of Wiadomo´ sci with the report of the deliberations of thejury, whom to give the award to for the best book of 1961. What a banquet on thisoccasion! Finger-licking menu:
vol-au-ventbrochet farci à la juive560Volume 3paupiettes de veau hongroisesoufﬂé grand succès
I see them—that moving imitation of the Academy and imitation of litera-ture—that sweet dream about distinctions with speeches, honey-coated compli-ments, anecdotes, praise, pufﬁng up one with the other and everything parléfrançais, of course, with Parisian piquancy and Galician culture in the best taste.Until it would seemThat Wojski was still playing. . . . But no, it was just an echo!*What does it hurt that a few older men get together to give themselves alittle pleasure or even delight? It would be wrong only if it were erotic, and this isabsolutely out of the question. And why shouldn’t they support one another, if themajority of them (I am skipping over the praiseworthy exceptions) have a hard timestanding up on their own? It is always merrier in a group. How can I hold it againstthem that they are eating away their fate with pastries—especially since thesespeeches, opinions, and views testify (I am skipping the exceptions) to the mostproper philosophical disorder and are calm, polite, decent, duly anachronistic, andsomewhat backward, in a word—harmless. It is worth depriving yourself of thatlittle bit of vol-au-vent and the brochet farci that melts in your mouth?Yet it is difﬁcult for me to refrain from indiscretion. What scandal hap-pened unexpectedly with the vetoes, namely, the stunning soufﬂé grand succès?Is it true, as they say—a thing impossible to believe—that when that heav-enly soufﬂé was served, someone . . . someone absent . . . someone uninvited . . .someone who was absent from the banquet, bah, someone completely shunnedand forbidden, ‘‘of whom one does not speak’’ and ‘‘of whom one does not evenwant to think,’’ someone despised and relegated to the darkest dungeon of thesubconscious . . .. . . that this someone sneaked up and ate everyone’s soufﬂé, exactly thisgrand succès? Horror! Only the soufﬂé itself remained on everyone’s plates becausegrand succès was eaten right out from under their noses!
(I dedicate this to Jan Rostworowski and Józef Wittlin)*A quotation from Adam Mickiewicz’s Pan Tadeusz.1962561Tuesday(I am Reading Mi™osz’s Book on Brzozowski,Man among Scorpions)
‘‘Why have so many people borrowed from Brzozowski’s accomplishmentshand over ﬁst, but stealthily, without admitting this publicly?’’ asks Mi™osz.Have I? I have a clean conscience. I have not met Brzozowski to this day, Ihave been able to manage my life so that nothing of his or about him has evercome into my hands. . . . Such oversights do happen, he is one of those Polishauthors who are most perfectly unknown to me. And in his way, when Mi™oszmentions his ‘‘obsession with liberating himself from Poland’’ or: ‘‘Brzozowski saidthat he burns with shame for Polish literature because it produced a Sienkiewicz,’’I am reminded of my own obsessions and embarrassment. Except that they are asdifferent and are executed from as different positions as our natures are different.As a matter of fact, I see, in reading Mi™osz’s prose, that I am in such sharpand fundamental opposition to this philosopher as I am perhaps to no one elseamong the enlightened Poles.For example:‘‘The Polish intelligentsia’s main sin, in Brzozowski’s opinion,’’ writesMi™osz, ‘‘is in substituting sociability for thought.’’ No one was seriously interestedin the philosophical attainments of the West. No one took thinking seriously. . . .No one experienced this great and sanguineous intellectual effort. . . . Theorieswere subjects for conversation.Mi™osz cites these words: ‘‘With what aristocratic calm, with what aristo-cratic offhandedness of judgment, were people and ideas slapped on the back. Thewise man absorbed in playing patience, or the national martyr yawning in betweencard games or market stalls, would look upon the son whose rose red-hot fromreading the works of Darwin or Buckle with an indulgent smile.’’I will establish the contrast between Brzozowski and myself by saying that inthis case I am on the side of the father not the son. Yes! I support the old gentry’sdistrust and the idea that theories are ‘‘impractical,’’ as is everything in general thatdoes not allow one to experience thoughts too much. And Mi™osz should stop beforenominating me for membership in Grydzewski’s Academy because it will soon bedemonstrated that my still water is not without a certain subcutaneous dynamics.562Volume 3I will ﬁrst try to describe in a few words our historical moment in contrastwith Brzozowski’s. His time was one of triumphant intellectualism, of a violentassault on all ﬁelds—it seemed then that stupidity could be weeded out by apersistent effort of reason. I believe that this intellectual assault grew in subsequentyears and probably reached its apogee directly after the Second World War—whenMarxism on the one side and existentialism on the other (not to mention otherrapacious ideas) poured over Europe like water boiling out of a pot. This broughtwith it incredibly broad horizons for people who devoted themselves to thinking.Yet . . . in keeping with that unfortunate dialectics of history . . . today, in myopinion, this period is ending and we are beginning to see the outlines of theperiod of Great Disenchantment. We have noticed that yes, the old stupidity isvanishing, but in its place is appearing another that the intellect is giving birth to, aby-product of the intellect, a stupidity that is, unfortunately, intellectual. . . .I assume that Mi™osz will agree with me when I say that the squire was lessprone to stupidity than today’s people are. The worldview of his times was based onauthority, the Church’s authority, ﬁrst of all; the farmer attended mass on Sundays,and on the other days of the week he gave himself up to innocent little thoughtsabout whether he should plant oats or clover. Even persons with a more abundantmental life did not indulge in philosophizing, philosophy went its merry way onlife’s peripheries, as something important perhaps, but remote. But today, each ofus has to rethink the world on his own because the authorities have bit the dust. Letus add that the intelligentsia is extraordinarily naive, in it lives a strange youthful-ness, there is a reason why it is one of the latest attainments of humanity, theyoungest. . . . These intellectuals, therefore, have not only commanded, think foryourself, with your own head, don’t believe anyone until you verify—but, as if thiswere not enough, they demand that you ‘‘experience thought.’’ No sweat! Not onlyam I supposed to think, but I am also supposed to take my thought seriously andfeed it my own blood! The monstrous results were not long in appearing. Swarmsof fundamental thinkers appeared out of the blue, thinkers reaching for the basicsand building little worlds for themselves. Philosophy became obligatory. Yet accessto this high-minded and profound thinking, studded with great names, is not at alleasy: and thus we have sunk in an awful quagmire of incomplete thought, in somesort of general indigestion, in the slime and mud of half-profundities.But, my likable Mi™osz, what is happening with the intellect and intellec-1962563tuals today is an absolute scandal—and a hoax, one of the greatest in all of history.This intellect has been ‘‘demystifying’’ for such a long time that it has ﬁnallybecame the tool of a monstrous deception. Knowledge and truth have long stoppedbeing the chief concerns of the intellectual—they have been replaced by the simpleconcern not to have anyone ﬁnd out that he does not know. The intellectual,bursting with contents that he has not make his own, hedges as much as he can sothat no one catches him at it. What are the ways of his caution? To formulate withsuch cunning that no one can question him. Not to poke his head beyond what heknows more or less. To use concepts with a kind of shorthand, as if they were alreadyquite well known but chieﬂy not to betray his own ignorance. Give the impressionthat you know. A special art has arisen that consists of the agile parrying of un-mastered thoughts with a face that is supposed to mean everything is normal. Thespecial art of citing and using names has also been developed. Of the thousands ofexamples that come to mind, let us take just this one: one of the most violentintellectual disputes after the war was the polemics provoked by Sartre’s demandthat the intellectual ‘‘commit himself’’ and ‘‘choose.’’ No man of letters couldavoid, practically speaking, expressing himself for or against. But in order to under-stand Sartre’s theses from Situations, one ﬁrst had to understand his ‘‘freedom,’’which, in turn, would have required the study of the seven hundred pages of hisBeing and Nothingness (yawn-yawn), which, being phenomenological ontology,required knowing Husserl, not to mention Hegel, not to mention Kant. . . . I askyou, how many of the people who discussed Sartre would have dared to havethemselves examined on the subject?And (considering the tireless work of woman’s womb) all the ingredients ofthis masquerade have to multiply and increase with each accelerating day. Ah, that‘‘sociability’’ which Brzozowski condemned has acquired an unexpected facet. . . .We are so bored by all these ultimate and profound truths that have to be fed ourown blood that, not really knowing how to reconcile our yawning with the profun-dity of our undertaking, we began to care only about maintaining appearances.Mi™osz is on Brzozowski’s side. Mi™osz wants the Polish intelligentsia tocatch up with the West. Here he is the mouthpiece of the postwar Polish move-ment in the direction of ‘‘Europeanism’’ and ‘‘modernity.’’ And I, my dear sir,vintage squire farmer, extend my hand and say: —Slow down! This is not the way!What in the devil do you need this for? First of all, you won’t catch up, because564Volume 3forms of thinking and style take shape slowly. Second, it is not worth it, because it’snot really worth the trouble. Third, it would be great if you would consider thefollowing: today you have the aces; your slowness is beginning to be on top; whathas been your shame until now can be introduced to Europe as a starting point fora salutary revision.Today, in my opinion, Polish ‘‘tepidity’’ has a chance and it should not beashamed. I would listen to a Polish voice in Europe with great pleasure, saying tothe intellect: enough, I don’t understand you, I can’t, I don’t want to. Only thismuch, nothing more. It would not be a matter of ﬁnding a way out but merely ofpresenting the situation . . . which only then would ﬁnd its people and solutions. Iam far from assuming that our proud ‘‘classicist writers’’ could become thesepeople who wrinkle their noses in disgust at ‘‘novelties,’’ wear ‘‘snobberies’’ thread-bare, and savor their own ‘‘mastery’’—nor could our dandies, gourmets, sybarites,jokesters, yarn spinners—nor our stout peasants, that dismal fraternity devoted to‘‘practical life.’’ No, none of these forms of intellectual doubt appeal to me. Itwould have to be done more honestly; and in a more European way; and moreintelligently.

Which of them is closest to hell? Tuwim? If there is something that was nothis lot, then it was that he could not get at hell with his poems, which were so fondof light, sheen, juice, color, the moment. Lecho ´ n? To all appearances quite areprobate in the ﬂesh, and if the heavens of his poetry were in proportion to hispersonal hells . . . but, what can we do, they were not. Wierzy ´ nski? Oh, yeah, ‘‘hedropped in, hell was on his way!’’ Iwaszkiewicz, S™onimski, Bali ´ nski—yes, yes,valuable but not profound. Who then? Wittlin? Wittlin, the blessed soul, would bemost likely to be from hell?Infernal or demonic—but I prefer ‘‘infernal,’’ it sounds stronger. How canthis be: Wittlin, that angelic sweet thing in a nightcap, practically straight out ofDickens, woebegone and ailing, respectable right down to the marrow. . . . Why1962565yes, Wittlin. And if I ever had to write a study of Wittlin, I would prove black onwhite that he is the way he is just so that he would not be his reverse—perversity. IfWittlin is holy, it is so as not to be diabolical. If Wittlin translates the Odyssey, thenit is not because the Odyssey appeals to him, but only so he does not destroy it.Wittlin busies himself with classicism but that is because Wittlin is anarchy anddespair. Calm? Balanced? Judicious? Friendly? Pedagogue? Master? Only so thatthe exploding bomb will not burst in his hands. And his faith is like that of thosewho pursue God, just as horses on a merry-go-round pursue each other, an eternalring-around-the-rosy.Am I wrong? I am allowed to be wrong in this diary, in my private notes.Wittlin, in my perception, is bourgeois demonism. Can a bourgeois bedemonic? Let us consider the following biography: a boy raised on the respectableprinciples of the past century, in a climate of culture, art, Christian morality,gentleness, and delicacy, initially goes through the ﬁrst European war and experi-ences it actively, as a volunteer in the legions, then as a soldier in the Austrianinfantry (that ﬁrst war did not have cataclysmic features, however, and it couldhave appeared to a bourgeois that it was the gateway to a nobler and gentlerlife). Furthermore, our young man becomes a teacher, educator, writer, contribu-tor to various publications, theater director, translator of Homer, author of theHymns and The Salt of the Earth—international fame, translations into manylanguages . . . Lovely career! But the career, conceived in a bourgeois spirit and itsafﬁrmation, is accompanied by disintegration, somewhere at the bottom, under-neath. Today’s Wittlin is still the same Wittlin, he hasn’t changed a bit . . . with thesingle difference that today he is suspended in a vacuum because history haspulled the ground out from under his feet. He is a bourgeois who got the bourgeoispulled out from under his feet. In this lies his demonism.If Sienkiewicz could be moved to our times, I doubt whether he would beparticularly troubled by it. . . . Sienkiewicz was a healthy nature, and healthynatures do not lose their vigor very easily. Wittlin, however, a bourgeois, came intoa world of bourgeois coddling, and this coddling made him susceptible to illness . . .and illness is actually the only brutality that could strike a bourgeois living inbourgeois ﬂuff. I should add that not only was (and is) Wittlin sickly but that he isdistinguished by a peculiar talent for being sick. It’s too bad I can’t remember all ofHemar’s amusing little bits of doggerel on the subject of Wittlin’s superbourgeois566Volume 3hypochondria. It begins with Hemar’s inviting Wittlin to a drinking bout. Towhich Wittlin replied:
I cannot, he said ruddy, but with a feeble voice.I have galleys to do and the ﬂu.
And Hemar concludes with:
Since the ﬂu is your obligation, the galleys your illness,I humble myself before you, king of neurasthenics!
Nothing other than illness, of course, a speciﬁc factor, linking us to thekeenest reality and liberating us from it into an unknown realm at the same time,enabled Wittlin certain achievements in poetry and prose. Because of his illness,he became an artist. But this talent for ﬁnding an outlet in his own indispositionsalso allowed him to get at the disease of the century, the disease of History at itsmost destructive and nihilistic extreme. Through Hitler and his own illness and,let us add, through his Jewish heritage, he reached the very edge of night.And this upstanding, modest man became suspended over an abyss—whata sight! If Malraux, Camus, Schulz, Mi™osz, Witkacy, Faulkner, are all hangingover an abyss, there is nothing to worry about because these are hangmen bynature. But when a decent man like Wittlin hangs over the abyss, the view canmake one dizzy and maybe even nauseous.And now the riddle, one of those ‘‘easy to give, hard to solve.’’ If Wittlin ishanging over an abyss, then what is the thread that he is holding onto, that he isattached to? You will say: God, because everybody knows Wittlin has a religiousnature. But I have already expressed my doubts on this point. I do not trust—this isintuition, nothing more—the efﬁcacy of Wittlin’s God, in my opinion he belongsto people who lean their foreheads against the windowpane and then everything isover. Oh! ‘‘All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.’’ Only twofeelings are left: ﬁrst, that you are caught like an animal in a trap without exit;second, that you are in a complete vacuum, a vacuum without walls, and so alsowithout an exit. Wittlin, this apprehensive man . . . but apprehensive in a sense thatreveals Nothingness. . . . I will ask therefore: if everything has slid out from underhis feet and if nothing is holding him at the top, why, instead of collapsing, does he1962567continue to be Wittlin and to bestow upon us his classical, balanced writing, notwithout its pedagogic vein?A nihilist pedagogue? An absolute bankrupt? Serene catastrophe? Kindlyhell? How did this bourgeois resist, as a bourgeois, although it was exactly hisbourgeoisieness that underwent complete liquidation? I once accused the Ska-mandrites and other émigré writers of not changing enough . . . and Wittlin?Compared to them, he hasn’t even twitched. Monolith? Except that a person forwhom everything is over and done with is in a different position than those forwhom much is over and done with. In what sense, in what direction, can a personwhose meanings and directions have evaporated change? What remains if not theone thing still left to do: repeat oneself? This is why people who appear completelydefeated by life function ‘‘as if nothing had ever happened’’ down to the very lastminute of their lives. The captain of a sinking ship knows that in a minute the waterwill swallow him up—him and his honor, responsibility, duty—that for all practicalpurposes these no longer exist, that the water is already reaching his calves . . . why,then, does he recite his captainhood to the last minute of his life, instead of, let ussay, singing or dancing? Perhaps because when there is nothing else to cling to,man can only grab onto himself, the principle of identity. ‘‘I am I’’ is a fundamentalprinciple not only of logic but also of the ultimate right of humanity; and wheneverything disappears, there is only the fact that I was someone; such a person andno other; and loyalty toward oneself appears to be the last law we can still obey. . . .Wittlin entered literature years ago as a creation of the bourgeois spirit ofthe time: Wittlin was the author of books, the bourgeoisie was the author ofWittlin. He did not scorn the bourgeois spirit—which left powerful achievementsin culture—in the least. I simply want to say that in this phase Wittlin created whilehimself being the creation of his own environment and epoch.Today? Today Wittlin is no longer just a creation of the bourgeoisie but hewho creates what is bourgeois in himself. Today Wittlin is his own creator, hesustains himself with his own strength. Externally, nothing has changed, Wittlin’smost recent texts are joined to the previous ones by a stubborn uniformity of tone,style, and vision and everything seems more possible than if he had veered fromhimself even by an inch. The only difference is that now Wittlin himself mustcreate Wittlin.568Volume 3But let us taste Wittlin’s goodness, for example. Let us taste it ﬁrst assomething natural that issues from him like juice from sugar cane. And then let ustaste it in its next embodiment, when it becomes ‘‘anti-natural,’’ isolated, onlyhuman, inborn, self-contained, self-conﬁrmed. Quite a difference in ﬂavor.I have sketched this little history to demonstrate that a man annihilated byhistory may, in time, become a creator of . . . his own history. What cheers me upmost in this scenario is the splendor of the contrasts: this hellhound, constantlydrawing from himself in hell the same goodness—delicacy—tenderness—equa-nimity—faith—good judgment—kindheartedness. . . . Just like the little spiders thathang good-naturedly by their own gossamer threads! ‘‘You will sit on a ﬁerce lionwithout giving offense and you will ride a giant dragon!’’
10.x., Tuesday
Madariaga, Silone, Weidlé, Dos Passos, Spender, Butor, Robbe-Grillet,etc.—all of them are in Buenos Aires, invited by the local PEN Club. The sessionslasted about ﬁve days and were a nagging pain on the subject of the Word, theWriter, Culture, Spirit, etc., as always. Everyone waited in vain for something tohappen; not even a ﬂy felt like sitting on anyone’s bald head. Occasionally, it istrue, the session would begin to skip a little and it seemed, yes, that it would kick upits heels but then everything would dissolve in their droning.I know all this from what others told me, I was not there—why? TheArgentine PEN Club had not invited me—aw, and why not? Why not? Bah! Whynot! Because instead of ‘‘he loves, likes, respects’’—‘‘he does not want, does notcare, he goofs around!’’ And why? Pooh, pooh! The persons who vote for membersof Wiadomo´ sci’s Academy will guess handily: because I’m a pain in the neck. Andespecially because of certain remarks I made about Argentine literature, publishedrecently in Quadernos. It is true that if they had invited me, I would not have beenthere either. I am not so stupid that I would commute to these sessions by taxi ortram—if they had offered me, as they did those other gentlemen, a ticket for atransatlantic journey, there and back, as well as accommodations in a ﬁrst-classhotel, well, that’s another story. But because I live in Buenos Aires about six blocksfrom the auditorium, I cannot demand that they bring me there via a transatlantic1962569voyage and, leaving all else aside, it would be too strange, if from the transatlantic Iwent to the auditorium straight through the ﬁrst-ﬂoor window.Yet maybe . . . just maybe it has nothing to do with the transatlantic butwith dignity?Dignity? I don’t know. I don’t guarantee it. I don’t want to be obligated.Last year Berlin University invited me to a similar conference, except witha slightly different program. Namely, that each of the invited guests was to readfragments from one of his works, which a translator present in the auditoriumwould immediately translate into German. The author reads for ﬁve minutes, thetranslator translates, then the author reads for another ﬁve minutes, etc. . . . When Ifound out that I was supposed to ﬂy ten thousand kilometers to read a passage fromPornograﬁa in Polish to Germans, I was mortiﬁed. And I did not go. More perhapsbecause of the enormity and depth of the water, but also a little out of . . .spiritual . . . and physical embarrassment . . . because, well, reading somethingPolish to Germans is hardly a spiritual coming together. And if not spiritual,then . . . hm . . . hm . . . physical. . . . At my age! I was ashamed and did not go.During these past few days I have had, out of shame, bitter feelings, it waspainful for me to see my colleagues in this situation. . . . Oh yes, I am angry at themfor this: that they knew neither how to refuse nor how to ﬁgure out the situation theright way! I saw them as wise people . . . and one is allowed to expect more thanaverage skill in self-conduct from a wise person . . . thus when one sees them, thesewise ones, up to their ears in stupidity, it hurts.These discourses about calling the writer to do battle with what is untrue,about his unmasking role—when they know darn well that they are babbling inexchange for the trip they got. And they know that everyone knows that they know!Once a courtesan said to me: ‘‘Everybody sells something. I sell my body.’’ And atleast she does not give papers on Authenticity at the Foundation of DevelopmentalPerspectives of Culture.
Thursday
One after another, they drove up, streamed in, ﬂew in, and the papersannounced every single bit of it. Having found out that Weidlé had arrived, I called570Volume 3him at the hotel. I did not know him personally but he wrote me a letter a few yearsago after reading Ferdydurke.It turned out that he had not forgotten me (it could have happened, younever know what can happen on these worldly waters) and he asked me to comesee him right away. So I shaved and, after putting on my coffee-colored suit, theone from Cervantes, and a green tie, a present from Ada, I walked to the hotel, notfar at all.It was a spring day and the evening sun was pouring into Peru Street,arousing playful ﬂashes in glass and metal. My approaching Weidlé was the ap-proach of someone little known, almost anonymous in Argentina, to someone longand solidly ﬁxed in the intellectual world. I was not surprised, therefore, by thewitty abundance of unleashed ﬂashes.Hotel. Auditorium. Electric lights. Curtains. He was holding somethingwhen he got out of the elevator: Pornograﬁa, the French edition. And he told me ina very disarming way that he had brought it with him from Paris in the hope that hemight meet me and that I would inscribe it for him.Which made me happy. I relaxed. But at the same instant I felt anger, that Ihad relaxed. And I knew that he knew (among ourselves we intellectuals knoweverything).
Friday
And then what? We barely had a chance to sit down when a reporter fromLa Nación lunged at him. Then a photographer. The photographer began to aim.The auditorium was full of international literary aces and photographers. I pro-posed we go to a café to have a talk in peace.We left. On the street a little man leaps up to him—and something rings abell from the past. Then the little man says to me: —You don’t recognize me, Mr.Gombrowicz? Aita. I greet him courteously because this is the president of theArgentine PEN Club, Antonio Aita, whom I have not seen in twenty-three years.Aita did the work of hundreds. He was the host and supervised: the pro-grams, hotels, receptions. . . . During our conversation Weidlé asked me a fewquestions that I could have answered by unloading my sarcasm. How was it that Iwas not invited? That Aita . . . who was he, what had he written? (Nothing.) What1962571was my life here like? But I didn’t get anything off my chest, fatigue interfered . . . akind of apathy toward London, Paris. . . . I answered politely and ‘‘naturally,’’without amusement or brilliance. Nothing was bright anymore anyway, the sunhad gone down.He walked me back to Venezuela Street, where I live, and, upon seeing myDiary in a German edition, said that this would interest him and that he knowsGerman well. I gave him a copy as quickly as possible, it means a lot to me, Iengage in my own politics, too.
Saturday
I take a peek at them in the auditorium while visiting Weidlé. Their—Europe. I have no desire to get to know them, why get to know the unknown? But Ilook at them while being one of them, beyond them—this is complicated—I lookwith the gaze of one who has been excluded and misunderstood. Rome. Paris.New York.They sit in armchairs—they stand—the press is handling them. How couldit be otherwise? The hyena of journalism had to fall upon this literature, easyplunder, defenseless as a lamb.I see them, expressing themselves, one after another . . . slowly, withconcentration, furrowed brow, before a person with a notebook, while a photo-graph—click! The next day I read the fruits of these confessions: coleslaw, mish-mash. Could it be otherwise? Even while listening to the man speaking, he, thejournalist, knew that he would have to make journalistic pablum from these far-reaching thoughts, on the run, in half an hour, so that his piece could maketomorrow’s paper; and while speaking to his listener, the speaker knew that hisdifﬁcult, rariﬁed, sophisticated thought, expressed any old way, ‘‘off the top of hishead,’’ in order to pass through another panting head of a journalist, would changeinto coleslaw, marmalade, a rabbit pulled out of a hat. In vain does he then try tosafeguard at least partly the importance of his thoughts with a ﬁnger, voice, eye-brow, ear. They know that it is in vain (intellectuals know everything amongthemselves). And, in spite of this, they speak with thoughtful expression, raisedﬁnger. . . .What fun for the newspaper!572Volume 3Fun and no fun. The newspaper is delighted, it is true, that it can frolicwith them on its own terms. And it prints up whole pages about them—features,reports on the sessions, anecdotes. Yet at the same time, the editors are biting theirnails and desperately asking: What for? Yes, what for? Why, if this watered-downbroth of dense thoughts will not be read but merely skimmed over—it is as if peopleread it but they do not. So what for? Oh, don’t ask ‘‘what for,’’ ask ‘‘why’’—when themechanisms are triggered ‘‘what for’’ is lost, only ‘‘why’’ remains. Why? Mecha-nism. Convention.Am I dreaming? It seems to me that a microphone made so readily avail-able by the press really strengthens the voice of literature, but by mixing it up in acompletely indecent brawl, not of the spirit but of the stomach . . . and now I recallwhat Delia said about the universally respected critic Guillermo de Torre, who ishard of hearing and wears a special device in his ear to amplify sound. ‘‘I was sittingnext to him in the theater. . . . Suddenly I heard—something amazing—theserevolting noises, absolutely unearthly, human yet inhuman, from some region ofgibberish, ferment. . . . And I was horriﬁed, thinking that this worldly mind wasspeaking to me, in a sudden attack of debauchery, not with an articulate tonguebut with a rumbling. . . . Then I understood: Guillermo had fallen asleep, thedevice had fallen out of his ear and onto his stomach, amplifying the rumblingcoming out of it.’’
Sunday
‘‘Gombrowicz did not, of course, pass up the stroke of luck that the appearanceof this Europe turned out to be. Immediately he—the indefatigable director—took to staging a little play: he, the province, against them, the world.‘‘Could this mean, however, that he did not feel that he was sittingﬁrmly in the international saddle? That he was losing himself when faced withEurope, he who was supposed to be shown onto the parquetry but was still fullof anxiety? This emphasizing of his own provinciality—wouldn’t it be honest tosome degree?!‘‘In that case—what hell! what torment!’’1962573Monday
I am tormented.Nothing compromises an artist more than another artist.Actually, an artist ought to cross to the other side of the street at the sight ofanother artist.One is an artist for the nonartist, for the not-enough-of-an-artist—for thereader-recipient. But when the artist meets an artist, both change into . . . Profes-sional colleagues. Into members of the PEN Club.These people were invited here from all parts of the globe, Cassou is forcedto exchange pleasantries with Silone, Weidlé is saturating Madariaga with his smile,Butor is bowing to Dos Passos and then nothing but: I am so happy to . . . I am verypleased to . . . I wish . . . Of course, with great pleasure. They encounter one anotherwith the greatest precautions, as if they were afraid to get dirty, all the mannersusually applied at diplomatic teas are in use; they look like a group of old countesseson a mission. And in spite of this, they destroy, devaluate, disqualify themselves.Upon seeing me the young Butor rose from his chair:—Vous êtes connu en France.I sank one of those absent looks into him: —Mais vous? Est-ce que vous me connaissez?He was silent. He had never read me. Nor I him.
Monday
Publicists, critics, theorists, men learned in art, like Madariaga or Weidlé,still come out of this unscathed—they have behind them the humanist tradition,masters degrees, they are disgraced less by the platform. The poets and novelists of‘‘pure art,’’ on the other hand, are amused by nothing, they look like pieces of rawmeat, thrown out to be devoured, like a gnawed bone. . . .Are they suffering? Doesn’t the conspired protest bother these tourists ofthe Spirit? How far have they sunk, I ask, are they ruined through and through?Oh, how humiliated I am by the innocent provinciality of my question—and themore I am ashamed, the more innocent I become! Sitting in an armchair, I look atthe hand of Dos Passos resting powerless and old on the arm of another chair. My574Volume 3sensitivity to hands is well known. I look at his creative hand, therefore, his author’shand, and I see it, as though it were on a platter, with a salad, mushrooms, oliveoil. The sleeve and cuff of the shirt are coming at the hand like a gigantic spoon,the ﬁngers of the hand suggest a fork, I look and think, how he is eating himself!And this hostile gastronomical and sneeringly restaurantlike thought is my armoragainst him . . . but what’s this? . . . There, to the side, in that armchair, Madariaga—next to Silone—farther in the interior three ladies, with whom Robbe-Grillet—Cassou in the fourth armchair—Butor in the corner, writing a letter . . . And I inmy armchair, I, who do not know Madariaga, who should get to know Silone,because if it gets out that I know neither Madariaga nor Silone . . . and shouldn’t Iask Weidlé to introduce me to Robbe-Grillet?Torture! Torture! My pride, howling like a dog! Consternation and vomitthat what I have sneered at a thousand times is getting to me and permeating me—I, a lover, so high-mindedly buried alive in Argentina for twenty-three years. Oh-oh—to show with one’s whole life that one doesn’t give a damn about honors, tomake fun of that mondanite, to be unbribable and inaccessible . . . in order tosuddenly, in a constellation of ﬁve armchairs, experience the most small-town sortof épater-ing and to feel the exigencies of the world, demanding that I be allowedinto this society, to become one of them! In some sort of frozen form I bore mycasual essence of a writer dependent only on acceptance into the group . . . andwhat will happen if it gets around that I was not accepted? Should I deny thisfeeling, spit it out? But the pressure of the courteous and immobile ﬁve-armedconstellation made me one of them—embittered that I was not one of them! Andhere I was not sparing them a bit of venom for their hotel club concentration,myself now helplessly included in their system of armchairs.One of the curtains, covering the windows of the hall, was drawn back . . .and through a crack I saw the street, sidewalk, houses, all ordinary and full ofdaylight, like in a picture. I sprang through the crack and began to grab con-vulsively at the faces of people ﬂickering by, I hung onto each until it disappeared,and then I hung onto the next one, as if this procession of passing faces could tearme out of the ﬁve armchairs in the quiet of the hotel, in the discreet gleaming ofthe chandelier. . . . Nonetheless, the faces passed, preoccupied, talkative, laughing,giddy, were passing, disappearing, and I sat here in the sixth armchair in courtesy,in silence. And so what? So what? So what?1962575Tuesday
‘‘He avoided irrelevant criticism, based on abstract sophistry. —I ﬁrst have toswallow the problem—he said—and only when my stomach begins to hurt, do Itry to deal with it. A trustworthy method! Who would not believe him whilewatching him externalize his most shameful complexes. . . . Yet, who wouldbelieve him? For we note immediately that this externalizing comes a bit tooeasily, it is too simple and cunning—and again, for the who-knows-what time,doubts begin to assail us: honesty or artiﬁce?‘‘He—the protean and open and obvious opposite of the monoliths,he—a gambler! If we had voiced our objections, he would have said his bitabout: the personality is like a costume we don over our own nakedness when weare supposed to meet someone; that no one is a personality when he is alone;that we can be several different people at the same time, and thus a certainlightness in manipulating personalities is highly recommended. Who knows,however, if this kind of response would not be too philosophical and whetherone could not seek the roots of this proteanism rather in what radically sepa-rates him from philosophy—in his artist’s nature. To paraphrase his own words,one could say that the ‘artist is form in motion.’ In contrast to a philosopher,moralist, thinker, theologist, the artist is endless play, it is not that the artistconceives of the world from one vantage point—endless shifts take place withinhim and only he can oppose his own movement to the movement of the world.‘‘That is why lightness often becomes profundity—for the artist. Light-ness—this is perhaps the most profound thing the artist has to say to thephilosopher. And isn’t it here that one should look for the reason that epochswith overwhelming metaphysical and moral anxieties, in which people try to ﬁxman in a speciﬁc character (as God’s creation; as society’s creation; as freedomﬁnally), were heavy epochs, bluntly oppressive, the least artistic. How pro-nouncedly the artism of our lives has changed since the year 1930, in proportionto our reviving desire for responsibility!‘‘Let us continue to look at our little jester—with what sort of leaps andsomersaults will he continue to amuse us?’’576Volume 3VI
Piriapolis
My notes about the congress of penclubbers . . . too much levity, too littlerebellion, I can’t say I am satisﬁed, is it possible that, infected with their impotence,I could not dig into my subject?Their literary decadence was not made clear enough—this literature is ﬂag-ging with each year, if not in the sense of the works themselves, then in the sense oftheir people. Indeed . . . if we cannot count more than ﬁve or six authentic compos-ers in the world per generation, it is difﬁcult to demand that there be many moreauthentic writers. The rest are, let us say, a few dozen gentlemen of the ﬁrst cate-gory who are not up to the demands of the assignment, although they are known,recognized, even famous and with prospects of having monuments, squares, andstreets named after them? . . . no, they are not really literature of good quality. Letus note the dread that issues from this statement. With this art butter things aresuch that if it is not of the best quality, of the ruthlessly best quality, it immediatelysmells of margarine.The elite of world literature becomes more and more numerous each year;but it also becomes more and more questionable with each year. This happensbecause the technique of imitating superiority, like all techniques, is making prog-ress. Excellence and even greatness is a matter of technique to a certain degree,however—and today an intelligent second-class writer knows pretty well what andhow to reform himself to get to the ﬁrst class. For example: it is better for me not tobe too spiritual, only sensual-spiritual; and one must mobilize one’s antinomies;the fog of indelineation is advised; the brutal directness of Rimbaud is also goodnor should one scorn some of the gimmicks of modern Yankees; and, just in case, itis better not to lose sight of certain prescriptions for ‘‘objective’’ greatness, propa-gated lately in France. Wholesale disqualiﬁcation of these measures of techniquewould be unwise . . . no, why shouldn’t someone who is not deprived of the Divinespark consciously create himself, using the experiences of others? Doesn’t realgenius begin, almost always, by imitating brilliance? And it does happen that thisimitative genius enters the bloodstream, becomes ﬂesh.1962577I don’t really have anything against this method. Nonetheless, thanks tothis, it is undoubtedly true that a certain European elite is growing weaker andweaker on its feet each year. These are usually people who have been exalted, whohave ‘‘made’’ themselves too much, whose excellence, deprived of spontaneity, is alaborious disquisition. Ninety percent—only ninety percent?—of today’s Frenchliterature is created by persons who cultivate a certain style, category, level that area collective attainment, contained in the intellectual, artistic air of France. Theirpersonal achievement is too often reduced to their being able to wear a store-bought suit as if it were specially tailored for them . . . but between Pascal’s Franceand Mauriac’s France there is as big a difference as between Maya naked and Mayaclothed. Compare the singularity of people from Verlaine’s period with today’sentourage, where almost everyone can be replaced. This is what is also happeningin other literatures. There was a time in European life when one could haveinvited Nietzsche, Rimbaud, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Ibsen to breakfast—peopleso unlike one another each one of them could have come from a different planet—yet what breakfast would not have exploded from such a gathering? Today one caneasily arrange a general banquet for the entire European elite and it would takeplace without a jarring note, without a spark.It is against this background of deadbeats that the increasingly disgracefulrole of the impresario is growing . . . evicted from the individual spirit, literature isgetting into the hands of extraspiritual social factotums. Prizes. Contests. Aca-demic commemorations. Professional associations. Publishers. Press. Politics. Cul-ture. Embassies. Conferences. One must, after all, organize these people and forcethem to function—function and organization become a leech that sucks out bloodthat is already anemic. This would not, in my opinion, be so much of a defeat if thepressure came only from the outside; a man of art knows that he is not a social man,he instinctively defends himself against the temptations of the layman. Everyoneknows that society will always demand what we cannot give. But what’s worse isthat, as I have said, literature is becoming less and less vigorous and because of thisit is losing its resistance and capacity to create antibodies, it might even seem thatsome sort of negative selection is going on, having a suicidal character. Not onlybecause the feebler artist is beginning to rule and to push around the better onewithin the framework of this bureaucracy (an artist, the better he is the less time he578Volume 3has for ‘‘functioning’’), but also because in the best, the unclean element gains theupper hand over the proud stubbornness of the soul. Lack of boldness. Decisive-ness falters. The inclination to make hardheaded, straightforward decisions thatcleanse begins to vanish, the world becomes muddled. They are not frank with thespirit, natural with the spirit, and because they themselves have fabricated some-thing of that spirit, they are not really so far from literature’s becoming a function,fabrication, production—they have in themselves that impersonal quality whichimposes pressure from the outside.Coziness! There is no way that invited, awarded, honored, feted, addled,ridiculed spirits will rebel and take the bit between their teeth and ﬁnd meanssufﬁciently explosive to shake up their situation. Let us resign ourselves to the fact:genius, talent, is dynamite less and less and not much has remained of the holyinnocence of forest or alpine ﬂowers. Since everything in society is functional, thesocial order of the spirit likes a certain production of superiority and greatness andthus a new category of functionary arises: the spiritual functionary.

Do I have enough strength and intelligence? And I am one of those whohas come to possess the technique of fashioning himself in the style of great art; Iconfess that I have come to possess subtle secrets in this matter, those even thatlead to results that are right next door to authentic greatness. Will I have enoughstrength, I who am like they are but perhaps even sicker?My truth and my strength rely on my endless spoiling of the game. I spoil itfor myself and others. I do not ﬁght artiﬁciality in myself. I simply limit myself to re-vealing it whenever it appears in me: I spoil my elegance, I force myself to use othertactics, I change the situation for myself. And I would ask this of my digniﬁed col-leagues as well: the endless spoiling of their elegance, ruining their situation, tearingthe cobwebs until the most deeply personal energies work their way to freedom.But . . . it is painful. . . . To ruin one’s situation . . .Sartre, in whom the pathology of the epoch has concentrated itself, is also aglaring example of this crisis—of greatness or of independence, or perhaps of thedignity of prominent people in a functional literature. Strange and painful is hissudden tumbling from the peaks onto the ﬂat plain, it looks as if he had two voices,1962579one that was categorical and of the spirit and the other—out of nowhere—of aschoolmaster and moralist. He is incapable of joining the realm of fundamentaltruth to the realm of daily affairs, with practical life; he lets out an unpleasant,trivializing inner squeal. Where does the proud extremity of his claim that litera-ture is freedom lead him? To his telling the writer what his social function is, that ofa schoolmaster talking to children: you are supposed to be here, not there, on theside of the left against the right! The chapter in Situations in which, after devastat-ing criticism, he gets down to positive guidelines and lectures on the role of thewriter in society, he exudes all the weaknesses of sermons, regardless of whetherthey are priestly or Marxist . . . and one can almost see how his loneliness is thenashamed and suffers.I have already passed over the strange simpliﬁcation in his reasoning: thatsomeone, by virtue of not being on the left, is thereby an enemy of the proletariat.But I can be a conservative and the most genuine communist at the same time—itis simply a matter of choosing the means that lead to the goal, this is an exploitationof man by man that is bearable. I can be of the opinion that the revolution costs toomuch, destroys too much, and merely increases the misery and slavery of themasses, and that the liberation of the proletariat can happen only on the path ofslow and careful, fairly conservative evolution, and I can even feel that an excessiveconcentration on this one problem is, in its ultimate consequences, damaging tothe development of humanity and, therefore, to the workers.But, I ask, which of the old philosophers could have borne in himselfSartre’s cacophony of levels, tones, concepts. They, however, less ‘‘made,’’ morenatural, did not know the desires of self-destruction and self-compromise, liketoday’s intellectual, who, in not trusting himself, decides on a brutal tone, issuingfrom the lower spheres. After going to bed with an elevator boy, the heroine of oneof Thomas Mann’s novels cries out in exaltation: ‘‘What, I, Madame so-and-so, apoet, lady of society, in bed with a naked elevator boy!’’ I think this anecdote is rightfor Sartre not so much because of the dialectics of the ‘‘base’’ which it contains asfor the ‘‘superstructure,’’ the elevator. For even in our time, one occasionally comesupon one of those scrupulous people who, panic-stricken that not his own sub-stance but a mechanism is raising him aloft presses the button of the same ma-chine to ride down as quickly as possible.580Volume 3Piriapolis, the Beach

Two perceptions of Wittlin. Wittlin, as it turns out, has a completely dif-ferent notion of Wittlin than I do. Furthermore, he writes to me: ‘‘Who I really amneither you nor I know. For my part, I admit that I do not have the time to concernmyself with this.’’From his letter, however, I can see that my thesis about his being a productand representative of bourgeois values does not please him. He writes that he comesfrom a family that lived in the country for generations; he was educated there, hecarries no city in his breast, and his life, heavy and replete with struggle, at ﬁrstmilitary, arms in hand, and later with a pen, is a ‘‘brazen denial of bourgeois ﬂuff.’’Agreed, I made a mistake by putting him in town if he is a child of thecountryside. Nor would I even think of accusing someone of being ‘‘bourgeois’’sensu stricto if I write that in all of émigré literature, he has more to do with hellthan anyone else. He is, in my view, an intense being for the reason that he joins inhimself (with the clarity of a mountain stream) extreme opposites, that he is an‘‘upstanding man’’ ﬁxed in catastrophe, living with the abyss.
BBB1962581The beginnings of my friendship with Vladimir Weidlé could also serve asan illustration of the powerlessness and inhibition overwhelming us literati at atime of laicized, socialized literature. Our conversations were very friendly butrough going; we were weighed down by the staging, he appeared to me in the auraof his function at the PEN Club congress, speech making, surrounded by thepress, invited—compared to him, I felt like someone emerging from the shadows,‘‘arriving.’’This lasted until he boarded his ship and left. There is no question that inthe current atmosphere of literary life the happiest moments are departures andseparations.After a few months . . . a letter from him in which I ﬁnd out that thisWeidlé, this solemn pillar of the congress, ﬂawless in manner and style, was aconspirator conspiring with me . . . and like me, a hidden enemy of the literaturethat he supported with his person, a person who hates the artistic ‘‘product,’’ and,just like me, a destroyer of ‘‘art’’ in the name of ‘‘humanity’’ . . . therefore myrebellion reached him in spite of everything and now he wrote to me, like oneiconoclast to another. . . . Except . . . except . . . this letter was at the same time awriter’s letter to a writer, from start to ﬁnish, he described professionally, literarily, that which constituted a spiritual desire—a tidy conscientiousness, polite respect,the kind that is combed and smoothed—this letter was like an anarchist in a tophat, with a bomb but in gloves, he drove before me in a stately limousine, like thepresident of a bank. . . .

Borges did not take part in the PEN Club congress but our tragic fate didnot spare him other ridiculous games.For he got on an airplane and together with his mother, doña Leonor,headed for Europe in search of the golden ﬂeece known as the Nobel. No other pur-pose inclined this man, over sixty, almost completely blind, and that old woman,who had behind her no less than eighty springs, to soar over there in a jet plane.Madrid, Paris, Geneva, London—lectures, banquets, garden parties—so that thepress would write about him and to set in motion all the mechanisms. The rest, I582Volume 3opine, is Victoria Ocampo’s doing (‘‘I put more millions into literature than Ber-nard Shaw was able to extract from it’’).Apparently some deputy in the Argentine Parliament wanted to proposethat the Senate, in a special session, appeal to the Swedish Academy of Litera-ture to give Borges the award (they have such an appetite for this Nobel, whichthey have yet to snag). Luckily they were able to talk the deputy out of it at thelast minute.Nonetheless Borges got on the plane. So now we have one more travelingrepresentative. One more fortifying the national soccer team in the great inter-national match. . . . Oh, that he not feel more like the ball than the goalie!The sight of this pathetic hermit blindman, with his almost ninety-year-oldmother, harnassed to these airplane efforts . . . the worse thing is that it ﬁts himsomehow. . . . And I don’t doubt that he will get the Nobel. Unfortunately, yesunfortunately . . . it is as if he had come into existence expressly for this purpose. Ifanyone, then Borges! This is a literature for literati, something like a special kind ofwriting for members of the jury, this is exactly the kind of candidate that is needed:an abstract artist, scholastic, metaphysical, unoriginal enough to ﬁnd a road al-ready paved, original enough in this unoriginality of his to become a new and evencreative variant of something known and recognized. An excellent head cook! Agourmet cuisine!I do not have the least doubt that Borges’s lectures on the ‘‘essence ofmetaphor’’ and the others by this same authority will be appropriately feted. Andthis will be exactly as it should be: sparklers, the ﬁreworks of an intelligentsiaintelligently deprived of intelligence, the pirouettes of rhetorical and unlivingthought incapable of taking on a single living idea, of thought completely unin-terested in ‘‘real’’ thinking, consciously ﬁctional, arranging its arabesques, glosses,and exegeses on the sidelines consistently ornamental. Bah, but the métier! Liter-arily ﬂawless! What a head cook! What could arouse greater enthusiasm in pure-blooded writers than this kind of bloodless, literary, verbal, unseeing writer whosees nothing except his own mental combinations?But he is just right, exactly like the cards we insert into machines so thateverything begins to turn and jump in rhythm. . . . If the measure of great literatureis its unliterariness, its capacity to overcome itself and get at reality, then one must1962583admit, this type of greatness does not interfere with Borges’s diligent efforts. Oh,but it is not Borges who irritates me, I could come to an understanding with himsomehow, face-to-face. . . . I am angered by the Borges-ists, that army of aesthetes,meticulous people, connoisseurs, initiates, watchmakers, metaphysicians, know-it-alls, gourmets. . . . This clean artist has a disturbing capacity for stirring up aroundhimself whatever is cheapest and most eunuchlike.5841963

18.v.63, Berlin
I am writing these words in Berlin.How did this happen? I went to Uruguay for January and February, thehottest months of the Argentine summer, to bury myself in forests overlooking theocean with my Cosmos, almost ﬁnished but still nerve-racking because the endingwould not reveal itself; it seemed to me it should be pushed into another dimen-sion—but where?—the solutions that came to mind were unsatisfactory. The forest,monotony of wave and sand, the smiling and bathed Uruguayan mellowness,turned out to be good for my work, I returned from the coast ﬁdgety with impa-tience to keep wrestling with the text and conﬁdent that the growing form wouldmanage the difﬁculties by itself. Then came the day I was supposed to go back toBuenos Aires. Half an hour before my departure—the mailman. A letter fromParis . . . in which I was being asked privately if I would accept a Ford Foundationinvitation to spend a year in Berlin.I have often experienced a blinding fog that invades life’s most importantmoments. Births prefer night but if deep stirrings of fate auguring MomentousChange cannot take place at night, then there is created around them, as if onpurpose, a strange confusion and blurring that distracts. . . . The invitation toBerlin solved a problem I had been mulling over for a long time and somewhatbitterly—of breaking with Argentina and returning to Europe—and already I feltthat the die was cast. But here was the ﬁrst perplexing and muddling complication:the letter was dated a month earlier, had gotten misplaced at the post ofﬁce, andcontained a request for an immediate reply (because this kind of invitation is a bitof good fortune many crave). Why did the letter get lost? Why wasn’t another letter1963585sent? Could it be—good God!—that nothing would come of it after all and I wouldbe left in Argentina?The following day I arrive in Buenos Aires and ﬁnd a telegram on my desk,urging a response. But the telegram is from two weeks ago. In the wake of acombination of neglect and bad luck, this one telegram, of all the mail that wasforwarded, was not sent. I wire that I accept—but by now I am almost sure thatnothing will come of it, that all was for naught, the devil take it, and that I, goodGod, would remain in Argentina!But something began to happen all around me . . . in these days of uncer-tainty, some aspects of my Argentine reality underwent a sudden awakening, itlooked as if this reality, in anticipation of a quick end, began to hurry and intensifyin all of its strangeness . . . this was most pronounced among the young people,which is so characteristic of my situation. . . . It was as if they suddenly realized thatsomething like me does not happen to them everyday: a ‘‘ready-made’’ writer with awell-known name who does not hang around with anyone over twenty-eight, anartist with a special aesthetic or pride who dismisses cultural luminaries withcontempt and boredom in order to be with young people, with those à l’heure depromesse, the incoming class from the literary foyer . . . this was quite exceptional,without precedent! But it was perfect—striking with that young-old juxtaposition,like a battling ram, at the literary beau monde of Argentina, breaking down doors,exploding hierarchies, causing scandal—and here these blousons noirs of art, theseiracundos (one of the groups called itself ‘‘Maufados,’’ the other ‘‘Elefantes’’),leaped at me, full of martial enthusiasm; they quickly ﬁgured out ways of inﬁltrat-ing the most important newspapers. Miguel Grinberg, the leader of Maufados,feverishly prepared his combative issue of the ‘‘revista’’ devoted to me—mobiliza-tion, movement, electricity! Which I watched in amazement . . . because it reallydid seem that they knew the end was approaching . . . but of course they did notknow. . . . I watched this in amazement but not without pleasure—because it alwayspleased my inborn sense of the perverse that in spite of the whole Grand Guignolthat deprived me of dignity in the eyes of self-respecting writers, I am nevertheless—peek-a-boo—someone serious and worthwhile. And the Grand Guignol particularto my situation grew in these last days in a truly incredible way, some sort ofeccentricity was also exploding in the press, there were more and more frequentnotices that I was an obscure genius, victorious in Europe, and Zdzis™aw Bau, who586Volume 3edited the social chronicle in Clarín, advertised me by publishing weird notesabout how ‘‘Gombro’’ was seducing dancers at fashionable health spas. Did thismadness reach the European salons of Madame Ocampo and what did our respect-able escritores make of it, if anything at all, if this reached their Olympus? Did theynot feel like Macbeth looking down from Dunsinane castle to the green forestapproaching him . . . in whose greenery farce, wildness, anarchy, sneering, waitedin ambush, but all of it raw, undercooked, substandard, practically from tenementbasements. I forgot about Berlin. All this promised some fairly good fun, the kindthat I like, that bowls you over, knocks you off balance, neither ﬁsh nor fowl, inept.Then came a letter from the Ford Foundation with an invitation.My foot touched Argentine soil 22 August 1939 and from then on I keptasking: how many years? how long?—until on this 19 March 1963 the end came insight. Pushed by the knife of this revelation, I died immediately—yes, all my bloodran out of me in a minute. Already absent. Finished. Ready to go. That mysterioussomething between me and my place had been severed.This end begged for understanding, for comprehension of what was hap-pening—but the obliterating and distracting whirlwind bore me away: documents,money, suitcases, errands, the liquidation of everything, I barely had two weeks totake care of all this, from early morning to late at night I rushed around in taxis,running errands and putting an end to things. I was ﬁnishing off friendships withan affection that was already gone, I got feelings out of the way, sorrows, thequicker the better, breakfast with X, supper with Y, faster, I won’t have time to pickup the parcels. . . . And so in these ﬁnal moments ﬂowers and fruits began to ripenviolently and unexpectedly, friendships that had been half-dormant for years beganto blossom, I saw tears . . . but I no longer had any time and it was as if these feelingshad put off realizing themselves until the instant in which I became unreal.Everything at the last minute and everything ex post. I must tell one amusing story:I am leaving at 7:30 one morning to take care of a dozen urgent matters, and hereon the doorstep is a maiden, an eighteen-year-old beauty, the ﬁancée of one of mystudents, called ‘‘Suitcase’’ by him because, as he claimed, going around with herwas like carrying a suitcase. ‘‘Suitcase’’ is sobbing, tears are rolling down hercheeks, she confesses her love for me, ‘‘and not just I,’’ she says, ‘‘all my girlfriendswere or still are in love with you, Witoldo, not one was able to avoid it!’’ And thus aweek before my departure I ﬁnd out about all this maidenly love—oh, amusing,1963587but then not really so amusing, this silly farewell triumph sent a cold little chill upmy spine: so these girls were also ready to play in my drama? How many times had Ibeen stunned and amazed by the unusually violent reaction of young people to thesuffering that was linked to them, this is a painful and helpless generosity, a handextended in friendship which can no longer reach. . . .Other blossoms and fruits were born in me in these moments before mydeath in the garden cultivated by my drama of many years—yes, a hurried violentmaturation, while I, an ascetic, ran around doing the shopping. Everything was inmotion, the strange onslaught of time speeded up by my departure was just likewhen it is ﬁve minutes to the arrival of the New Year, movement, stress. I could nolonger grasp anything, everything was falling out of my hands and getting lost, as ifit were being seen from a train window. Never was I more alone—or more careless.I tried in spite of everything—sometimes feverishly—to impose some sort ofform on this exodus of mine. I saw an analogy between these last days and the ﬁrstones in 1939, only a formal analogy, it is true, but I clung to it in my chaos and I didﬁnd a little time to make a pilgrimage to the places that were once mine. I droppedby the large building at 1258 Corrientes, called El Palomar, swarming with all sortsof poor folks, where I spent probably the hardest period, then in the closing monthsof 1940, sick, without a peso to my name. I climbed up to the fourth ﬂoor, saw thedoor of my room, the familiar blotches and spatterings on the walls, I touched thedoor handle, the railing of the staircase, the old insistent melody from the dancehall below rang in my ears, I recognized the old smell . . . and for an instant, staringat something invisible, I waited, thinking this very act of returning would be able togive form and sense to the present moment. Nothing. Nothing at all. Emptiness.Void. I stopped by one more building, at 242 Tacuari, where I lived in December of1939, but this visit was even less successful. I walk in, get in the elevator to ride tothe third ﬂoor where my past was, and out crawls a porter.—Who did you come to see?—Me? . . . Mr. Lopez. Does Mr. Lopez live here?—No Mr. Lopez lives here. And why are you getting into the elevatorinstead of asking at the caretaker’s window?—I thought that . . . On the third ﬂoor . . .—And how do you know he’s on the third ﬂoor if you aren’t sure that he liveshere? What do you really want? Who do you want to see? Who gave you the address?588Volume 3I beat it.April 8. The harbor. A café in the port, right next to the white monster thatwas supposed to bear me away—a table in front of the café, friends, acquaintances,greetings, hugs, well, hang in there, remember us, my regards to . . . of all this justone thing was not dead, one thing I saw, which for some unknown reason willalways stay with me, because I, that is, I looked accidentally at the water of the port,for a split second, I saw the stone walls, a lamp on the sidewalk, next to it a polewith a sign, a little farther launches and boats rocking, the green lawn of theshore. . . . This is how Argentina ended for me: with one careless, unnecessaryglance in an accidental direction, a lamp, sign, water, this got sucked up into meforever.Now I am on the ship. The ship moves. The shore recedes and the cityemerges then drifts away, the skyscrapers sink slowly behind one another, perspec-tives blur, confusion enters the geography—hieroglyphs, puzzles, mistakes—the‘‘English tower’’ from the Retiro is still visible, not where it should be, there’s thepost ofﬁce building, yet the panorama is elusive and dreamy in its complexity, as ifreluctant or forbidden, perhaps maliciously deceptive—the city is closing itselfbefore me, I now know so little! . . . I reach into my pocket. What? I am missing the$250 I took with me for the trip, I pat myself all over, I run to the cabin, I search,maybe the money’s in my coat, in my passport, no, it’s not there, hell! . . . I will haveto sail the Atlantic with the pesos I have left, with about $3! But there, on theoutside, the city is ﬂoating away, concentrate, don’t let them steal this farewell fromyou, I rush back on deck: now it was askew, at the edge of a sheet of water, aconcentration of indistinct matter, a fog with a contour woven in here and there,my eyes no longer understood anything, plasma with some sort of too difﬁcultgeometry . . . and this difﬁculty, growing without end and debilitating, was accom-panied by the sound of water parted by the prow of the ship. And, at the same time,the $250 were tearing into the 24 years of my life in Argentina, the moment wassplitting into 24 and 250, oh, gloomy and crazy mathematics! Robbed twice, I wentto take a look at the ship.Supper and night, earned by my great fatigue. The next day I went out ondeck, the roar, billowing, heavenly azure, the deeply plowed ocean, the wildblossoming of foam in space consumed by the repeated madness of violent move-ment, the prow of the Federico strikes at the heavens and falls into the depths,1963589spurts of salt spray, there is no way to keep standing without grabbing hold ofsomething . . . there, on the left, about ﬁfteen kilometers away, the shores ofUruguay, and aren’t those hills familiar, the ones surrounding Piriapolis? . . . Yes,yes, and now I can see the white blocks of multistoried hotels in Punta del Este andI swear, a sharp ﬂash reached me from over there, the kind the sun creates whenreﬂected from car windows—bright and far-reaching. This ﬂash from Punta delEste, from some car, on some turn, was the last human word uttered to me fromthe America I knew, like a shout, reaching me in the enormous disorder of the sea,under a sky that was somehow cursed and it strengthened the pervading turmoil.Farewell, America!Yes, but what sort of America? The Atlantic greeted us with a thunderstormthat was uncommon (the steward later told me that there hadn’t been one like thisin a long time), the ocean was annihilating, the wind was stiﬂing, and I knew thatin this frenzied desert (as indicated by our direction) Europe was looming beforeme—yes, it was already getting closer, but I didn’t know what I was leaving behind.What sort of America? What sort of Argentina? Oh, what had they really been,those twenty-four years that accompany me to Europe? Of all the encountersawaiting me, one was most disturbing. . . . I had to confront one white ship . . .heading from Gdynia to Buenos Aires . . . and which I would meet inevitably in aweek’s time on the open seas. . . . It was the Chrobry. The Chrobry from August of1939. I was on it and so were Straszewicz and Rembieli ´ nski, the senator, andMinister Mazurkiewicz, the whole jolly group . . . yes, I knew I would have toconfront the Gombrowicz sailing to America, I, the Gombrowicz sailing awayfrom America. What a monstrous curiosity about my destiny gnawed at me, I feltmy fate like a dark room, where you have no idea what you’ll break your neck on,how much I would give for the slightest ray to illuminate the contours of thefuture—and so today I am approaching that other Gombrowicz, as solution andexplanation, I am the answer. Will I, as an answer, be up to the task? Will I be ableto say anything at all to that other one when the Federico appears to him on thefoggy expanse of waters with its powerful yellow chimney, won’t I have to keepsilent? . . .That would be painful. If he asks me, curious: —What are you returningwith? Who are you now? . . . I will answer him with the troubled gesture of emptyhands, a shrug of the shoulders . . . and perhaps something like a yawn, ‘‘Aaahh, I
