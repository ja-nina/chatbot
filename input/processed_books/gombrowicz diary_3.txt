590Volume 3don’t know, leave me alone!’’ The rocking, wind, noise, the enormous heaving andstirring merging at the horizon with the motionless sky whose stillness was imm-portalizing ﬂuidity, and in the distance, on the left, glimmers the American shore,an introduction to remembering. . . . Will I not muster a different answer? Argen-tina! Argentina! What sort of Argentina? What was it—Argentina? And I . . . what isthis now, this I?Drunk with the evasiveness of the deck as it moved from under my feet inall directions, clutching the railing, thrust into a staggering bewilderment, addledby the wind—green faces all around, confused looks, huddled ﬁgures—I tear my-self away from the deck and, demonstrating a miraculous balance, I walk . . .suddenly I look, something is lying on one of the deck planks, something small. Ahuman eye. There was no one here, but next to the stairs on the upper deck therewas a sailor chewing gum. I asked him:—Whose eye is that?He shrugged.—I don’t know, sir.—Did somebody lose it or was it poked out?—I didn’t see sir. It has been here since morning. I’d pick it up and put it ina box, but I am not allowed to leave the stairs.I was just about to resume my interrupted march to the cabin, when anofﬁcer appeared in the curve of the stairs.—There’s a human eye lying on deck.He showed genuine concern: —I’ll be damned! Where?—Do you think that it fell out or was taken out?The wind was snatching our words, we had to shout, but the shout also ﬂedinto the distance, it was hopeless, too battered by the wind, I kept going and thegong sounded, announcing breakfast. The dining hall was empty, universal nauseahad stripped the tables of people, there are six of us bold folks staring at theseesawing ﬂoor and the incredible acrobatics of the waters. My Germans (becauseI share a table with a German couple that unfortunately speaks Spanish the way Ispeak German) did not show up. I order a bottle of Chianti, and the 250 jabs meagain, like a needle—how will I pay the bill I am signing? After breakfast I send aradio telegram to friends in Paris to wire a $200 money order to the ship. I amtraveling comfortably, I have a separate cabin, kitchen, a good one, like that time1963591on the Chrobry, what a life. . . . Life? What is this journey if not a trip into death? . . .people of a certain age should not move at all, space is too tied up with time,rousing space provokes time, this whole ocean is made more of time than ofboundless distances, this is inﬁnite space that calls itself: death. What the heck.In reﬂecting on my Argentine life over a space of twenty-four years, Inoticed without difﬁculty a certain distinct architecture, noteworthy symmetries.For example: there were three periods, eight years each, the ﬁrst period—poverty, aBohemian life, no concerns, inactivity; the second period—seven and a half yearsat the bank, the life of a clerk; the third period—a modest but independent exis-tence, growing literary prestige. I could also conceive of this past by averagingcertain subjects: my health, ﬁnances, literature . . . to order it in a different way,from the vantage point of problems, ‘‘themes’’ in my existence, slowly changing intime. But how is one to drink of the soup of life with the slotted spoon of thesestatistics and graphs? Bah, one of the suitcases in my cabin contained a briefcase,and that briefcase contained a whole slew of yellowed sheets with a month-by-month chronology of events in my life—let us look, for example, at what washappening to me exactly ten years ago in April 1953. ‘‘Last days in Salsipuedes. I amwriting ‘Sienkiewicz.’ Ocampo and walks to the Rio Ceballos, late night returns. Iam reading The Captive Mind and Dostoevsky. Returned to Buenos Aires on thetwelfth by train. The bank, boredom, Zawadzka, misery, letter from Giedroyc thatthe book is not selling but that he would like to publish something more. At theGrocholskis and Grodzickis. ‘Banquet’ in Wiadomo´ sci . . .’’ etc., etc. I could prodmy memory this way, take a walk from month to month in the past—but what of it?What should I do, I ask, with this litany of particulars, how should I absorb thesefacts, when each one disintegrates into a swarm of smaller events that ultimatelyturn into a vapor, I was being hemmed in by billions of facts, dissolution in anelusive continuity, something more like a tone . . . how can one talk about facts atall? Yet while sailing to Europe, after everything was over, I was beset by the purelytyrannical necessity of getting at this past, of grasping it, here, in the roar andtumult of the sea, in the restlessness of waters, in the boundless and noiselesslymelting ﬂood, along with my departure on the Atlantic—and was I really supposedto be just the senseless sputter of chaos like these waves? One thing became clear:this was not a matter of intellect or even a matter of awareness, it was simply amatter of passion.592Volume 3To be passionate, to be a poet toward it . . . If Argentina had won me over tothe extent (now I no longer doubted it) that I was deeply and forever in love withher (and at my age one does not cast these words to the ocean winds), then I had toadd that even if someone were to kill me, I would be unable to say what had led meastray on this boring pampa, in ordinary bourgeois towns. Her youth? Her ‘‘in-feriority’’ (oh, how many times the thought—one of my great, exciting thoughts —had occurred to me in Argentina, the thought that ‘‘beauty is inferiority’’)? Buteven though these and similar phenomena, supported by a friendly and innocentlook, by a dazzling smile in a somewhat cinematic setting, full of color, heat,efﬂuvia, or maybe palm trees, played no triﬂing role in my seduction, my Argen-tina was still something a hundred times richer. Old? Yes. Triangular? Yes, that too.Also square, blue, but also sour in the spiral, a little bitter, yes, but also internal anda little like a polished shoe, gopherish like a post, or gate, and of the turtle species,exhausted, dirty, overﬂowing like a tree hollow, or a trough, chimpanzeelike,corroded, perverse, sophistical, monkeyish, and chummy with sandwiches, similarto a dental ﬁlling . . . oh, I am writing whatever crawls under my pen, because it’sall the same, whatever I say would ﬁt Argentina. Nec Hercules . . . Twenty millionlives in all possible combinations, that’s a lot, a lot, for the single life of one man.Could I have known, what took hold of me in this mass of tangled lives? Findingmyself without any money? Having lost all of my Polish privileges? Having thisAmerican Latinness somehow complement my Polishness—or maybe the south-ern sun, the dissolution of form—or perhaps their speciﬁc brutality, dirt, shab-biness . . . I don’t know. . . . And, furthermore, the claim that I was in love withArgentina did not correspond to the truth. I was not really in love with her. Toexpress myself more clearly, I merely wanted to be in love with Argentina.Te quiero. An Argentinean says, ‘‘I want you’’ instead of ‘‘I love you.’’ Imeditated then (still on the ocean, tossed by the ship that was tossing on the waves)that love is an effort of will, a ﬁre we kindle in ourselves because we want to,because we want to be in love, because we cannot stand not being in love (thecoarseness of my articulation corresponds to the awkwardness contained in thevery situation). . . . No, it’s not that I loved her, but I wanted to have myself in lovewith her and apparently I needed desperately to get close to Europe in no otherway except in a state of passionate intoxication with Argentina, with America. I1963593probably did not want to show myself to Europe at the close of my life without thebeauty that love gives, and perhaps I feared that tearing myself away from a place Ihad saturated with myself, moving to unknown places, unwarmed by me, wouldimpoverish, cool, and kill me—thus I desired to be passionate in Europe, passion-ate with Argentina—and I quaked especially before the one meeting that awaitedme (on the open seas, at dusk, perhaps early dawn in the developing salt-spaciousmists) and there was no way I wanted to appear at this rendezvous absolutelyempty-handed. The ship pushed forward. The water raised and buried it. Thewind raged. I was somewhat helpless, abashed, because I wanted to love Argentinaand my twenty-four years there, but I did not know how. . . .Love is dignity. This is how, at my age, it had seemed to me; the greater thebiological defeat, the more necessary the passion of a consuming ﬂame, it is betterfor you to burn than for you to slowly, cadaverously, cool off; passion—now I knewthis—is prescribed more for old age than for youth. Night falls. Absolute night.From the left side, barely, barely, somewhere out there, winking lighthouses re-cede on what is already the Brazilian shore, while here, on the deck, I strainforward, edging farther and farther away, without respite, in an inconceivablemarch . . . this was a desert. The inﬁnity of the rushing emptiness, thundering,exploding, impossible to distinguish, to grasp, made of eddies and vortices, thesame here and there and still farther and farther still. I am straining my eyes untilthey hurt, all in vain, I couldn’t see a thing; on the other side of the wall of nighteverything was pouring in and out in an unending drowning and dissolving, I knewthat behind the darkness, there at the bottom was nothing but formlessness andmovement, before me nothing but inessential space, above, a sky studded withcountless stars, impossible to distinguish, to grasp. . . . Still I strained to see.Nothing. Did I really have the right to see, I, chaos in confusion, oblivious, lost,whipped into passions, pains, that I did not recognize, how is it possible that one isnothing more than spilling water, vacant space, dark night, boundless sky . . . ablind element inaccessible to itself. O Argentina! What kind of Argentina? Noth-ing. Dud. I couldn’t even desire, all possibility of desiring was excluded by theexcess of the all-exhausting spilling, love was spilling into nonlove, everything wasrunning together, I must go, sleep a while, it’s late, the human eye, where did Iget that human eye on deck? . . . Had I imagined it, how do I know, well, it doesn’t594Volume 3matter, eye or no eye, because why, tell me, should I play at formalities, shoulda phenomenon be asked for its passport, what pedantry . . . and can you see,better sleep.

My notes from this journey? Here you are.
Wednesday, 10 April
The storm is over. Gentle seas. A woman comes up to me: —Senior Gom-browicz? An acquaintance, as it turns out, of Ernesto Sabato, an Argentine womanfrom the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She introduces me to her millionaire friend,who is knocking off her twenty-ﬁfth trip to Europe. I ﬁnd out from them that thenew chargé d’affaires of the Argentine embassy in Warsaw is aboard the ship.The chargé d’affaires invites us for a drink.The conversation is about the problems that arise when a Pole who hasbecome an Argentine citizen and lives in Argentina is still considered a Polishcitizen by Polish authorities.Cognac.The meeting with the multimillionaires and the chargé d’affaires gives mesome hope as far as the 250 is concerned.Coffee.Correspondence. Chess with an aviator.All while the mountainous shores of Brazil loom on the left, where visionends.
Thursday, the 11th
Yesterday Santos.Today Rio de Janeiro.To hell with the views! Views are ridiculously stupid! I really prefer pettytheft. To saunter off the ship for an hour, to stand on an unknown corner and to1963595steal . . . the sight of a stumbling peddler out of whose hands ﬂies a bunch ofbananas that then trip up a child . . . to steal something to which one has no right,something happening ‘‘over there, in Santos,’’ to catch, to take.The tiresome euphoria of Negroes.
Saturday
The mingle-mangle, basking and ﬂoating, colors and light, quiet, warmerand a lot warmer, hidden gleam in streaks and mists, clouds bristling with sun-shine, ﬁsh jumping, imaginings and sunny processions, behind us a bubblingstreak, foaming tail, they play, games and amusements, deck chairs and lyingaround, camera in a shoe, the light hurts, the pool is open, they jump in, get outsnorting, jump, conversations, chats, an industrialist, ha, ha, ha (in a stentorianvoice), she took out a notebook, that one is scratching himself ja, bitte sehr, buongiorno, probably got offended, she left, maybe not, waved his hand, whose is this,copper gleams, he dove well, what time is it, oh, no, how was it with this then . . .who ﬁnally . . . quail, why did he not know how to, oh, goose wrist in the back, whatwould happen if . . . locomotive . . . locomotive . . . for example . . .‘‘For example’’ is the perfect phrase, comfortable, making it easier, AdásMauerberger said to me once, probably in Konstancin, on the veranda, that wordssuch as ‘‘for example’’ or ‘‘actually’’ make things easier . . . with their help one cansay everything, even something that is incompatible with the truth, one can say‘‘actually bread and butter taste like chocolate.’’ The slowspreading blue indo-lazifying skyspansiveness and isn’t it better to leave, to leave it untouched, let itslowly sail away, and so long . . . Argentina, Argentina, Argentina!Argentina! Sleepy, squinting, weary, again I am searching for it in myself—with all my might—Argentina! I wonder and would like to know, I wonder, why inArgentina I never came upon this passion for Argentina in myself. Why is itattacking me now, as I leave it?My God, I who did not love Poland for a second. . . . And now I am standingon my head to love Argentina!It is curious, too, that the word love was forbidden you until now. And now,here, you experience shameless attacks of love. Oh, oh, oh (this is difﬁcult for me596Volume 3to write, difﬁcult to edit—as always, when I increase the candor in myself, the riskof being excessive, pretentious, grows, and then stylization is unavoidable) . . . Andsurely—I thought—surely this is nothing more than growing farther apart: not tolove Poland because I was too close to it, to love Argentina because I always had itat a certain distance, to love it now, yes, when I was moving, tearing away . . . andsurely because in old age one can demand love more boldly, bah, beauty too . . .because they already appear at a distance, allowing for greater freedom . . . and theyare more concrete, perhaps, at a distance. Yes, and one can love one’s past from adistance, as I am being removed not just in time but in space . . . carried away,subject to the uninterrupted process of growing more distant, of tearing away, and,in this growing distance, consumed by a furious love for what is growing moredistant from me. Argentina—the past or a country?
Monday
The tarpaulin is ﬂapping, the furrow foaming—the tail gurgles—the sailingrustles—many deck chairs—games and conversations—ahhh, the muted murmurof voices, dreamy amusement, ahhh, luminous crease, gleaming copper, lines andbars are drawing a net of silken shadows, salt and distance, instability in the blueand someone says traigalo aqui, someone turns over, air.I was looking for excursion points from which I could leap onto Argentinain a conquering tiger’s pounce. There was a boy, perhaps ten years old, Daniel, aUruguayan, jumping into the pool . . . with such bodily ease that even for Americathis ease was too facile. The ﬂawless soft, dark skin, beneath which played muscleschildishly elastic—the coordination and silence of the body, as if every movementhad been oiled, eyes, ears, delightfully, childishly laughing, a black head of softwavy hair, a sparkling animation—and unbelievable unceremoniousness, unbe-lievably friendly in attaching itself to others—which, however, at its peak momentsbecame identical to some sort of wild indifference or even simply wildness, be-cause one could see that it was all the same to him whom he got close to. . . . Why,this boy wanted mostly to attach himself to children, he ran at them, grabbedthem, picked them up, joked around, gentle, chaotic play, making the groupof children ecstatic as it ran after him in leaps and shouts . . . but at somepoint turning into an arbitrariness that was wildly indifferent and, after all, no less1963597intimate. . . . Behold Argentina! . . . Yes, this is Argentina! . . . and it seemed to methat I had captured it here in this Hispanic-American child, why not? . . . Yet next tohim, not far away, lounging on the deck chair a lovely miss with the corners of hermouth turned down, distaste and bitterness hung from her lips like Negro orna-ments, distaste and revulsion, a thin hopelessness—and I said suddenly to myself,‘‘This is Argentina,’’ and I felt as if this country, growing distant and already faraway, formed itself for me in these lips, in its past as well as in the present, in itscities, rivers, mountains, streets, cafés. . . . And whatever happened to me inArgentina could be expressed just as well by that child as by that frowning mouth,those embittered lips . . . but then I looked at the lining of someone’s jacket andthought I could also ‘‘grasp, express, master’’ Argentina with that lining. Drinks.Someone is taking a picture. No big deal. Side. The tarpaulin is ﬂapping, thefoaming streak is bubbling, all suddenly turn their heads left, bang, a shot, skeetshooting, and in this simultaneous turning of heads, Argentina is also containedsomehow. We are sailing. Penknife. She cried out. Earring and death. Somethingwas always happening, constantly, as if on a ﬁlm screen, it didn’t stop for a minute,and, in not stopping, it did not allow me the conquering pounce, oh, perhaps Iwould have reached the past, if now had stopped happening.Sheet and chimney. Elbow. Sailor. Attendant. Oh, any sort of feelingtoward the irrevocably disappearing was impossible because of the multitude offacts . . . facts and facts . . . a pleiad of facts, facts were hatching, a swarm of eventswere attacking me like locusts as I retreated, I could not simply detach myself fromfacts, and thereby their enraged abundance led to some sort of furious degradationof them, nothing could exist seriously because the other was at its heels, I was neverdevoured by facts to such an extent, tarpaulin ﬂapping, foaming trail, fun andgames, thread and heel. Stupidity. Simpleton. Take it out. Went out. Hop. Sil-houette. Noise. Bottle. Pray. Cradle. Skin . . . and in the noise, in the gleaming, inthe speeding ahead and the leaving behind, the approaching and the sailing away.Oh, how the present moment was sucking me dry, how it was weakening me! Wewere passing the northern shores of Brazil, the Federico was drifting with an aver-age speed of eighteen knots, in a favorable tail wind. I watched the ﬂeeing shores ofAmerica. Farewell, America! In proportion to evening’s fall the degradation of factsthat I mentioned, facts hatched and dissolved in noise, as well as rocked, merging,and blurring, began to bother me more and more, but I was not so completely sure598Volume 3of this, immersed as I was in noise and rocking, devoured by leaving . . . but just amoment, let’s take one such event, as much as I could see, as much as I couldobserve, quite brazenly even, it happened, for example, sometime after eleven(and not at night, but the next morning, in broad daylight), it happened, let us say,that one of the sailors, a certain Dick Harties, through inattention swallowed theend of a thin line, hanging from the mizzenmast.Because of, I think (but I can’t speak of this with complete certainty, manyother facts were clamoring for my attention), because of the peristaltic action of hisalimentary canal, he began to draw the rope into himself violently and, beforeanyone noticed, rode it to the top, like a mountain funicular, with his mouth wideopen, terriﬁed. The wormlike nature of his alimentary canal turned out to be sostrong that there was no way to pull him down, in vain did a sailor attach himself toeach of his legs. It should be added that at this time the ship was moving withoutinterruption, I was getting farther from . . . in any event, some sort of consultationswere undertaken, after which the ﬁrst ofﬁcer, named Smith, hit on the idea ofgiving him an emetic—but once again the question arose as to how to introducesomething to make him vomit into his alimentary canal, completely ﬁlled withrope. Finally, after longer consultations than before (during which whole hosts ofevents approached and ﬂew over us in noise, dying away in the rocking), theydecided to act upon his imagination through his eyes and nose.This is what happened (the scene has become ﬁxed in my mind as much as ascene that is constantly getting farther away can become ﬁxed). At the ofﬁcer’s com-mand, one of the sailors climbed up the mast and presented the patient with a plateof rat tails. The unlucky fellow’s eyes were ready to pop out of his head—but when asmall fork was added to the tails, it all reminded him suddenly of the macaroni of hischildhood and, vomiting, he slid down to the deck so fast he almost broke his legs. I,I admit, preferred not to watch this scene—whose garishness was weakening andfading just like ancient chromolithographs from somewhere, out of a trunk, attic,vivid, yes, but as if it were being seen through smoky glass, as if it were lost forever.
Tuesday
We broke with the American continent. The Transatlantic on the openAtlantic, crosses the equator aiming its prow for Europe.1963599Curiosity? Excitement? Expectation? Why, no. The friends whom I hadnever seen awaiting me there—Jele ´ nski, Giedroyc, Nadeau? No. Paris, thirty-ﬁveyears later? No. I don’t want to get acquainted. I am ﬁnished and summed up.I wander aimlessly . . . and everything I think of is a little farther behind inthat very instant. My thought is behind me, not ahead of me. Telegram from Kot Jele ´ nski—that they are supposed to send me two hun-dred dollars. The money has still not arrived. In Las Palmas maybe?Boring. Not one interesting face. Chess. I won the tournament, got amedal, and am now champion of the ship.Reaching death with a backward motion? (I do not trust these kinds of‘‘thoughts.’’)
Wednesday
Architecture.A cathedral built without respite. . . . I build this ediﬁce and build . . . Icannot catch a glimpse of it. Sometimes, at exceptional moments . . . it is as if Iwere discerning something in a ﬂash . . . the joints of vaults, arches, some elementof symmetry . . . mere appearances?In 1931 . . . and how could I have know then that Argentina would be mydestiny? The word never gave me the least hint.But I did write a short story at the time entitled ‘‘Incidents on the H.M.S.Banbury.’’ In this story I sail to South America. Sailors sing:
Under the azure skies of ArgentinaWhere the senses are slaked by a wonder of a girl . . .
By strange coincidence, the short story was translated into French a few monthsago and perhaps has already appeared in Paris in Preuves. I am sailing toward it.Illusions! Mirages! False ties! No order, no architecture, the darkness in mylife from which not even one real element of form emerges—while today wholepassages of this story attack me, born of memory, pale, desperate, like apparitions.‘‘Imagination like a mad dog let off the leash bared its teeth and growled silently,crouching in corners.’’ ‘‘I have a weak mind. I have a weak mind. Because of it thedistinction between things is blurred. . . .’’ ‘‘The deck was completely empty. The sea600Volume 3boomed impressively, the sea wind huffed with redoubled force. The raging trunk of awhale loomed in brackish waters, tireless in its circling motion.’’I would also like to mention that the ‘‘meeting’’ took place today at day-break, northeast of the Canary Islands. I put ‘‘meeting’’ in quotation marks, thisword does not have its usual value. . . .I did not sleep that night, I went out on deck before daybreak, looked longthrough the darkness at a thing one can always look at: the water. I spotted thelights of a few ships, slitting the ocean to Africa . . . ﬁnally the night, I will not saythat it grew lighter, but it vanished, collapsed, got lost in itself, meanwhile whitedensities appeared here and there which in the rawness of an indifferent predawnemerged like cotton, and the sea swarmed with these white icebergs of fog, amidwhich I saw what one can always look at, the water, waves striding like roosters inwhite. Then it sailed out of its white wrapping, also white, with an enormouschimney that I immediately recognized at a distance of three or four kilometers. Itimmediately fell into a puff of fog, again peeked out, I did not look out, it is true, Iwas staring instead at the water . . . knowing well that this was not happening, thisdid not exist, I preferred not to look, but my not looking was a kind of conﬁrmationof its presence. How curious that not looking can be a form of looking. I alsopreferred not to think and not to feel in vain. Yet how curious that not thinking andnot feeling can be a kind of feeling and thinking. In the meantime, the phenome-non was drifting by—and not drifting by me in a phantasmagoria of windblownpuffs with an almost operatic pathos and something like a lost brotherhood, like akilled brother, dead brother, mute brother, a brother lost forever and indifferent . . .something like this appeared and took over the hollow despair and was utterlymute among white puffs.Finally I thought about myself on that deck—and that for him over there, Iam probably the same sort of phenomenon as he is for me.Then it was as if I had suddenly recalled that aboard this very thing, yearsago, sailing on the Chrobry to Argentina, one night near the Canary Islands, Icould not sleep and at daybreak I went out on deck to look at the sea . . . and I waslooking for something . . . I immediately conﬁscated this memory because Inoticed that I was fabricating it, as we have already mentioned, for architectonicreasons. What a mania: you look into a crystal ball, into a glass of water, and evenout of that comes something out of nothing, a form. . . .1963601Friday, 20 April
Europe before me! Paris!On the day before Paris, when I should have had the gleam, hardness, andsharpness of a razor, I am blurred, distraught, dissolving. . . .I have not been in Paris since 1928. Thirty-ﬁve years. I hung around Paristhen as an insigniﬁcant student. Today Witold Gombrowicz is coming to Paris, andso we have receptions, interviews, conversations, consultations . . . and one has tocreate a certain effect, I am going to Paris to conquer. Many people have beendrawn into this battle and they expect an effect. And I am sick! Parched lips,blurred vision, fever . . .In this slackness I am tormented by the necessity I know is inevitable—thatin Paris I will have to be the enemy of Paris. Never mind talking about it! They willswallow me up too easily if I don’t become a pain in their side—I will not be able toexist if they do not perceive me as their enemy. No, no scruples in regard to such aposture ad hoc, coldly premeditated, sincerity is nonsense, there can be no talk ofsincerity when one knows nothing of oneself, when one has remembered nothing,when there is no past, when one is nothing but the ever-receding present. . . . In afog, like mine, moral scruples?It would be hard to come by a fate more ironic: that I, again, now, in mybewilderment, ebb, must sculpt myself in the fog that I am—and have to transformthis fog, dust cloud, into a ﬁst!
Sunday, Barcelona
Today, the twenty-second, I touched European soil, I have long known thattwo twos are my number. I also touched Argentine soil for the ﬁrst time on thetwenty-second (of August). Hail, magic! The analogy of numbers, eloquence ofdates . . . you miserable creature, if you can’t catch yourself in anything else, at leasttry this.I walked to the square where there is a statue of Columbus and I glanced atthe city in which, perhaps, I will settle permanently after Berlin (every word of thissentence horriﬁes me: ‘‘I walked’’ and ‘‘to’’ and ‘‘square,’’ et cetera).They horrify me beyond description and ﬁll me with despair, that I am602Volume 3carrying myself around these places, like something even more unknown than allthese unknown places. No animal, reptile, crustacean, no imaginary monster, nogalaxy is as inaccessible and alien to me as I am (a banal thought?).You strive for many long years to be somebody—and what do you become?A river of events in the present, a turbulent stream of facts, happening now, at thiscold moment that you are experiencing and you can relate to nothing else. Confu-sion—only this is yours. You can’t even say good-bye.The two hundred dollars showed up neither in Las Palmas nor in Bar-celona. . . . So what now? Where will I get money for tips and checks? Themillionairess!
Monday
Cannes, at night, illumination, quite a sight. I had barely gotten ashorewith my suitcases when a young lady from the agency comes running up andhands me two hundred dollars (luckily the millionairess lent me some moneyaboard the ship).Night in the hotel. The next day (rain) I speed along in the Mistral to Paris,mountains, sea, lake, the Rhone Valley, the train bellows and rushes, the dining car.Paris at one in the morning, the hotels are packed, the taxi driver ﬁnallygets me into a hotel not far from the Opéra which is called the Hôtel de l’Opéra.I open the window. Like an idiot I look from the ﬁfth ﬂoor onto the smallstreet, Rue du Helder, I inhale the air I breathed thirty-ﬁve years ago, I open mysuitcase, I pull something out of it, I begin to undress. The situation is perfectlysoulless, completely empty, absolutely quiet and deprived of everything. I go to bedand turn off the light.
Wednesday
First I call Kot Jele ´ nski. Taken aback (because he did not expect me foranother few days), he explodes into greetings. And I: —Please, Kot, without a bigfuss, let’s pretend that we have known each other a long time and that we just sawone another yesterday. He came to the hotel, we went to a café on the corner,1963603where ﬁrst he talked about all sorts of projects related to my arrival . . . then webegan to gab a bit. . . .This is how I became acquainted with Jele ´ nski, who, having smashed myArgentine cage, built me a bridge to Paris. And so what? Nothing. Peace and quiet.I returned to my hotel.What’s this? An opportunity to hate Paris—an opportunity that struck me asurgently as ﬁghting for my life—it has already awakened and is looking for prey. Afew passers-by while I sat in the café with Kot were enough, the accent and smell ofthe French, their movements, gestures, expressions, clothes . . . antipathies longnourished are breaking out. Am I becoming an enemy of Paris already? Will I bean enemy of Paris? I have known my Paris phobia for longer than just today. I knewthis city touches my greatest vulnerability, my age, the problem of age, and it was asure thing that what I had against Paris was its being a city ‘‘over forty.’’ Oh, insaying ‘‘over forty’’ I do not have in mind the age of its thousand-year-old walls—Iwant to say only that it is a city for people reaching their ﬁfth decade. Beaches arefor young people. In Paris one smells forty, even ﬁfty, in the air, these two numbersﬁll the boulevards and squares.If this feeling cut me to the quick now, it was not because of its intellectualcontent, but because it was poisoned with poetry. Poetry forced me to such violentrevulsion. On the wall of my room hung a lithograph of the moment in the vault ofthe Sistine Chapel when God, in the ﬁgure of a powerful old man, strains towardAdam to breathe life into him. I looked at Adam, who was about twenty, and atGod, who was well over sixty, and I asked myself, whom do you prefer, God orAdam? Do you prefer twenty or sixty? And the question seemed extremely impor-tant to me, bah, even critical—because it is not an indifferent matter what sort ofideal of man and humanity slumbers within you, what sort of beauty you demandfrom the human species, what sort of man you want to have. Man, yes, but of whatage? There is no one man. Which man is the real man for you . . . the most beau-tiful . . . the most happily formed physically, spiritually? Or perhaps you consider achild the highest embodiment of human beauty? Perhaps an old man? Or do youalso think that everything over thirty, or below, is ‘‘worse’’? In looking at God andAdam, I meditated that the most splendid works of the spirit, reason, technology,may become unsatisfactory for the sole reason that they are an expression of a604Volume 3human age that is no longer capable of arousing love or admiration—and you willhave to discard them, in spite of your own recognition, in the name of a more pas-sionate reason, connected with the beauty of humanity. And, in allowing oneselfthis little sacrilege, I rejected God in Michelangelo’s painting in favor of Adam.I did this, though, to forge a weapon against Paris—because as a writer I hadto separate myself from Paris.

I have not had a lot of time for walks—former and new friends, Frenchliterati, publishing matters, translators . . . —but in each contact with the street ofParis I looked for ugliness . . . and I found it. This seeking of eyesores was some-thing like an act of love on behalf of the Cast Off (Argentina)—but for me it was notjust a matter of decorating myself with love, I did not forget that I had to irritateParis. . . .I drew physical defects out of the crowds, oh, look, ﬂat chest, anemia of theneck, hunchback, twisted trunk, the tragedy of those limbs . . . and this closescrutiny of bodies resulted in my not having any looking left for palaces, churches,squares, views, arches, bridges, cupolas. . . . I was persistent in seeking out a certaindefect, a kind of very French inelegance dancing about their very noses, lips, not ofall Frenchmen, but quite a few. I could forgive this, though. The French mob is inno way worse than the crowds in many other cities, Parisian ugliness is locateddeeper, it is ﬁxed in their attitude to ugliness, this intelligent city is a city ofconscious ugliness. On the Avenue de l’Opéra, on the Rue de Rivoli . . . oh, howthey knew each other, too many mirrors, too many hairdressers, tailors, and fashionplates, cosmetics, oh, how they drank the cup of ugliness to its very dregs! I saw theworry of wilting ladies, the bitterness of emaciated young poets, the diligent styliza-tion of men in beards, the obese resignation of pot-bellied men, the strangestattempts at sublimating themselves into aesthetics with the aid of hats, even um-brellas, a relentless battle with ugliness was being fought every step of the way andat every step it was being marked by defeat (which fascinated me because I wanted606Volume 3to beautify Argentina for myself ). I saw the permanent distaste on the faces ofMessieurs-Dames, as if they were snifﬁng something unpleasant and Paris smelled,to me, of negligees, of that hour of the day when we do our daily ablutions, thehour of creams, powders, cologne, bathrobes and pajamas. All this would still havebeen bearable, but this ugliness conceals yet another, more painful one consistingof gaiety. This was really bad! I would have forgiven them their sadness and de-spair; what I could not forgive them was their ugliness because it was cheerful . . .well-stocked with humor, esprit, and blague!There, on the corner, a rotund old fogy looked cheerfully up the skirt of ayoung thing boarding a bus—tout Paris chortles at his beaming roguishness.I look with horror as an inﬂated, rosy-lipped chef, standing in the doorwayof a restaurant, sends peppery bons mots in the direction of Madam, so sophisti-cated in the curves of her body that she almost resembles a labyrinth.So they did want to enjoy life after all. . . .These scenes did not ﬁll me with enthusiasm and I had no desire to greetthem with full recognition violà Paris. Susanna and the elders— violà Paris! I felt (and not just I in this city, I was not the ﬁrst) a profound distaste at the sight ofgreedy ugliness. A sensuality that can no longer express itself naked throws itselfinto lipstick, corsets—into elegance—into costume and manners—into conversa-tion and art—into song and joke—that ‘‘sociability’’ whose sundry defects created asplendid ball when they danced together—this esprit, which allows one to pinchwith charm—and that awful ‘‘gaiety,’’ diligently nurtured throughout the ages inorder to be able to have fun in spite of everything . . . hideousness so aware of itself,so amused! This repulsive aesthetics contained a deadly naïveté, based on theillusion that one can mask years and take one’s delights to some higher level,where they can come true in another dimension.O Paris, I thought to myself, Paris, you old tenor, wilted ballet dancer,hoary joker, what is your mortal sin against Beauty like? Is it not that you eat it?Mais permettez-moi donc, cher Monsieur! Monsieur, getting on in years, stops beingthe beau garçon, that is, the generous, blissfully disinterested beautiﬁcation of theworld, beauty, which is a gift . . . but should his relations with beauty have endedhere? Not in the least! Life is still full of charm! He may, for example, drop into arestaurant chosen from among thousands and order Veau à la Crevette Sauce1963607Moustache, or Sautée Velay Mignonne Asperges . . . and he can even ask to beserved Fricassée de Jeunes Filles en Fleur or un Beau Garçon rôti à la Bordelaise,dishes undoubtedly tasty and light!The culinary metaphor whose sense is such that in order to consumebeauty you must completely break with it; not only must it come to you from theoutside, on a platter, but you must also arrange yourself internally so your uglinessdoes not interfere with your pleasure; and this ploy is something so pitiful that Idoubt anyone with a higher degree of development could do it to himself—itrequires a person to cast himself into a collectivity, into sociability, the cooperationof others, one must ﬁrst create a system of coexistence, culture, where the surro-gates of beauty such as belles manières, élégance, distinction, esprit, bon goût, etc.,etc., could replace abject nakedness. And then, having put on Swann’s top hat, youcan be a gourmet without embarrassment! The Top Hats have relegated the great,real beauty of the human race, the young and naked beauty, to statues standingquietly among the trees of Paris, and it is these statues the Top Hats look at withtheir expertise, as if this were merely the object of their cultivated pleasure. Thus ifresigning from one’s own beauty is worthy of praise when it leads to pure con-templation, it becomes repugnant when it happens under the auspices of greedand desire. If I ﬁnd something unaesthetic to the bone—I thought, trodding theseavenues—then it is a gourmet . . . it is Paris!This city, dissolving ambrosias in its aged mouth! While walking in Parisrather downcast, extinguished and quiet, I thought that the only thing lacking wasfor them to sneak up to the naked statues one night and dress them in the latestfashions, daub them with perfume . . . Diana in Dior toilet, yes, this would matchtheir penchant for mondanité, producing tasty substitutes for beauty. But, I re-peated to myself, but real beauty is naked! And man cannot be loyal to this beautyin any other way than through his own nakedness—if not the one you are par-ticularly in currently, then that which you had—and if you did not have it, thenthrough the one you could have had, in keeping with your age.But the tailor dressed Paris’s nakedness. When they see une belle femme,they have a haberdasher’s ﬁt, the ecstasy of Top Hats has no bounds, a Top Hat willfall in love and subject his feelings to subtle analysis . . . but he will never undress.The roles will be divided, nakedness is only on one side. . . . I don’t know if what608Volume 3they told me is true, that they put gloves on to caress and, when undressing la belle,they button themselves up quickly, down to the very last button.

And Hector Bianchotti took me to the Louvre.Crowded walls, the stupid hanging of the paintings, one next to the other.The hiccups of this accumulation. Cacophony. Public house. Leonardo is punch-ing Titian’s face. Everything is cockeyed because when you look at one, the othercrawls into your eyeball from the side. . . . Walking from one to the other, standing,looking. The light, color, and shape that gladdened your heart a moment before,on the street, here crossbreed to produce so many variants they crawl down yourthroat, like Fleming’s quill at the end of an old Roman feast.Until ﬁnally you get to the holy corner where she—La Gioconda—presides!Greetings, Circe! . . . just as industrious and engaged as when I saw you last, indefati-gably transforming people not into pigs, no, but into dolts. I was reminded of Scho-penhauer’s horror at the thought of the eternity of the mechanism by dint of whichsome turtles have been crawling out of the sea every year, for thousands of years, inorder to lay their eggs on some island—and every year they get eaten, after layingtheir eggs, by wild dogs. Every day for the last ﬁve centuries a small crowd gathers be-fore this picture in order to experience a cretinous gaping, this famous face stupeﬁestheir faces every day . . . click! An American with a camera. Others are smiling indul-gently, in blissful ignorance that their own cultural indulgence is no less stupid.Stupidity is in great abundance in the rooms of the Louvre. One of thestupidest places on earth. . . . Long rooms . . .Forty thousand painters in this city, like forty thousand cooks! All of thisdabbles in beauty. Its fabrication on canvas by reﬁned ﬁngers allows them anintentional, it would seem, nurturing of ugliness in themselves, rarely fashioningthemselves on monsters having beauty only in the tips of their ﬁngers. One entersthis painting like some great perversion, like a gigantic masquerade, where theartiﬁcial creator creates artiﬁcially for an artiﬁcial recipient to the accompanimentof vendors, snobs, drawing rooms, academies, riches, luxuries, criticism, commen-tary, where the market as well as supply and demand create an abstract system,built on ﬁction . . . and what is so strange about Paris being its capital?610Volume 3A model, undressing for a painter, is the equivalent of a woman dressing forDior or Fath. Both stop being naked in an instant. The nakedness of one becomesthe pretext for a dress. The nakedness of the other sinks into the painting. Onebecome ‘‘elegant.’’ The other becomes ‘‘art.’’

Since my arrival in Paris, strange things have been happening to me inconnection with Sartre.I, in Buenos Aires, had long admired him. Alone with his books, having allthe advantages of a reader when I could have done him in with one curl of the lip, Ihad to be afraid of him the way we are afraid of someone stronger. But in Paris hebecame an Eiffel Tower, a person overwhelming the whole panorama.It began with my deciding—out of curiosity—to test whether the Frenchintellect had absorbed Sartre’s existentialism . . . and by steering the conversationto Sartre I would discreetly plumb writers and nonwriters on their familiarity withBeing and Nothingness. My research had startling results. First of all, it turned out(and this was not a surprise to me) that these ideas bounced around and mean-dered in French heads, but in a larval state, drawn from wherever they could getthem but mainly from his novels and the theater, absolutely murky, fragmentary,still having to do mainly with the ‘‘absurd,’’ ‘‘freedom,’’ ‘‘responsibility,’’ but it wasclear that in France Being and Nothingness is practically an unknown work. Sure,his thoughts prowled around in people’s heads but rather loosely and in a way thatmade them seem crippled, truncated, torn to pieces, a little wild, awful, and weird,causing a weakening, an undermining of the order of previous thought untilnow. . . . Further results would be much more interesting. I was struck by theantipathy with which they discussed him, not antipathy perhaps, something like anincidental inclination to murder. Sartre? Well, yes, naturally, except that he ‘‘re-peats himself so.’’ Sartre? Yes, but that was yesterday. . . . Novels? Plays? ‘‘Actuallythey’re nothing but illustrations of his theories.’’ Philosophy? ‘‘Nothing but thetheory of his art.’’ Sartre? Yes, but there is already too much, why does he write somuch, and he’s so slovenly and not a poet, politics you know and he is ﬁnished,Sartre, you know, he’s ﬁnished on all fronts.This made me stop and consider. . . . In our admiration for artists thereis a lot of maiden-aunt goodness, which praises the little boy in order not to1963611worry him—the artist has simply been able to buy his way into our good graces, hehas won our sympathy to the degree that we are happy to be able to admire him—and not admiring him would cost us too much. This is evident in the Frenchattitude to Proust, who is fed sweets even in the grave—he was able to win themover. But Sartre is probably the only outstanding artist who is personally hated.Who, in comparison with Sartre, the mountain of revelation, is this ArgentineBorges? A tasty soup of writers? Yet they coddle Borges and pound Sartre . . .is it only a result of politics? This would be unforgivable pettiness! Pettiness? So isit not politics but pettiness that is behind this animosity? Is Sartre hated because heis too big?The course of my thoughts in Paris was haphazard, chaotic, and permeatedby a speciﬁc kind of extremism . . . as a consequence of the accidental juxtapositionof Sartre and Proust, all of France fell apart into Proust and Sartre. When one day Imade a pious pilgrimage (I, a born antipilgrim!) to the windows of Sartre’s apart-ment on that little square next door to Deux Magots, I no longer doubted that theyhad chosen Proust over Sartre. Yes, they had chosen the restaurant du coté de chezSwann, where elaborate morsels were served, prepared by a chef who, himself agourmet, knew how to encourage delectation. I was told once that high-class chefsusually kill the turkey slowly, with a pin, for the meat is tastier then—well, now, toreturn to Proust, I will not deny him a tragic air, severity, even cruelty, but all ofthis, like the turkey’s torments, is edible after all; it contains a gastronomic inten-tion, remains in touch with the platter, veggies, and sauce. . . . And on the otherside, du coté de chez Sartre, was the most distinct French thinking since Descartes,with an enraged dynamic that destroyed all their tasting. . . . Stop! What? Two orthree girls, two girls, a group bubbling with laughter, playful, a charming, youngFrance suited to nakedness, tears into my meditation, they walk by the square,disappear at the corner—Sartre sort of hurt me in that instant, I felt that he wasruining them . . . but when they disappeared from view, when I saw Messieurs-Dames before me in a gastronomic age, I understood that for them there was nosalvation beyond Sartre. He was a liberating energy, the only energy that could tearthem out of ugliness—I will say more, French ugliness, accumulating for centuriesin apartments, behind curtains, amid bibelots, and not being able to stand itselfanymore, produced Sartre, a sinister Messiah . . . he alone could destroy theirrestaurants, drawing rooms, top hats, galleries, cabarets, feuilletons, theaters, rags,612Volume 3scarves, reduce the Louvre, the Champs-Elysées, the statues, and the Place de laConcorde at sunset, and the Bois de Boulogne to ashes! It was not shocking to me;on the contrary, it is admirable that this philosophy was born in an unprepossessingFrenchman, and with such a passionately artistic sensibility. Who had more rightto demand withdrawal behind the object, behind the body, behind the ‘‘I’’ even,into a sphere pour soi, where one exists for oneself? To introduce as Nothingnessinto man—but this also leads to cleansing oneself of ugliness!Sartre, not Proust! The powerlessness of Proust when compared withSartre’s creative intensity! How is it they did not notice this! Half of his deductionsfrom Being and Nothingness are unacceptable to me, they do not correspond to mytruest experiences in life and I am convinced that his cogito cannot survive itsabsolutism, and that in spite of its singularity it demands some sort of other,supplementary principle, equally fundamental but antinomous—for it is easy tosee that in his concrete application this thought sins with its awful one-sidedness, itlooks as if one face were being taken away from a two-faced god; this is half thetruth. And Sartre, as a moralist, psychologist, aesthete, politician, is for me only onehalf of what he should be. (Should I add, however, ignoramuses, that I also do notknow Sartre well, that in spite of my admiration, I have not read all his works, thatin Being and Nothingness there are chapters I have only glanced at?) It is certainthat it is he who is breaking down closed doors, no one else. That which in Proust,in all of French literature, is the continuation but pretty close to the end, in Sartretakes on the character of a beginning, a start. And if in Proust the awareness iscontinually greedy (but what a tumble when compared with Montaigne), in Sartreit regains the pride of a creative force.I, a Pole . . . I, an Argentinean . . . Slav and South American . . . writer lost inParis and hungering to sting, to annoy . . . I, the melancholy lover of a lost past . . . Isought an alliance with Sartre against Paris. And I was tempted by that little trick inorder suddenly to elevate and isolate someone already cataloged.

I am not attacking Paris from any other angle, and I limit myself to beautyin getting even with it; perhaps because I am, however, an artist to some extent,maybe because I am still ﬁxed in that cast-off, that beauty beyond the ocean; andmaybe because beauty is a galling argument.1963613But what sort of cult of nakedness am I talking about when I say that Parishas lost its nakedness? Could I be more precise?I do not demand that they worship the body, nature, naturalness, simple-heartedly and I do not demand that they sing hymns to nudists.But I do demand of man that the idea of the beauty of the human specieslive in him—this he should not forget. ‘‘I belong to a race that enthralls me.’’ ‘‘Iworship the beauty of the world through human beauty.’’That is why it is important, even very important, that we never break withinourselves with the period of the human lifetime in which beauty becomes accessi-ble—this is youth. For whatever beauty is gained in old age, it will always beincomplete beauty, marred by a lack of youth. This is why young beauty is nakedbeauty, the only kind one need not be ashamed of.And someone constantly joined to youth will never like clothes. This is thefoundation of my aesthetics. I am all about this aversion to clothes. That is why Iwill never reconcile myself to Paris, which adores clothes.

A different matter: I have become the winner of Wiadomo´ sci’s award for theDiary.I will say honestly that this gave me much pleasure, and even joy. And I willsay honestly (nothing except honesty!) that the description of the ties and tormentsof the jury, also included in this publication, entertained me even more. All of itworked out splendidly. In the discussion Mr. Zygmunt Nowakowski made the bestimpression on me as an upstanding fellow, honest and certainly not petty—I wouldshake his hand gladly, but I know he wouldn’t want me to. General Kukiel alsospoke frankly, tersely, and to the point—bravo! Mr. Grubi ´ nski was a model ofcaution and restraint, and Mr. Stanis™aw Bali ´ nski did what he could so that I wouldnot get the award, but instead of doing it with class, he twisted, connived, andschemed, demonstrating a rather hackneyed hypocrisy and a small-caliber perﬁdy—this poet is less and less to my liking, his format is too pocket-sized.I owe thanks to the persons who fought for me. Mr. Sakowski gave animperious speech that was about 75 percent honest (which is really something). Aslong as we are talking about honesty, I regret that the gathering could not manageto state one ultraobvious truth, namely, that I was granted the award under pres-614Volume 3sure, simply because they could no longer keep someone worshipped by Paris andother capitals under a bushel basket without creating a scandal (I am not referring,of course, to those few members who have long tried to force me through at the riskof their own good reputations). Why, tell me, should they pretend they werediscovering, after scrupulous consideration, the virtues of my pen, if this Honor-able Jury found out about these virtues from the French and other nations (not tomention such scorned ‘‘lipsmackers’’ as Jele ´ nski, Sandauer, and Mieroszewski)?Truth is no sin! Honesty! A man feels better immediately! It particularly surprisedme that the poet Bali ´ nski led everyone to believe that he had recognized my worksbefore the war. Phooey, what snobbery! How could Bali ´ nski have known suchsacred mysteries!I will add with no less frankness that the honorable members evidence toomuch servility toward each other. I was fortiﬁed by all the praise that came my waybut my jaw dropped when I found out, incidentally, that Mr. Zygmunt Nowakow-ski is a ‘‘great writer,’’ that ‘‘ten serious and seasoned experts’’ make up the Jury, thatKukiel’s book is ‘‘splendid,’’ that Mackiewicz’s book is ‘‘Dostoevsky with a touch ofTolstoy,’’ that Mr. Z. Nowakowski is ‘‘steadfast,’’ that Messrs. Kukiel and Nowakow-ski are ‘‘excellent,’’ etc., etc. My dear gentlemen, if I sing my own praises inthe diary then at least we all know I am doing it for myself, but to divide self-gloriﬁcation into voices and to create for this purpose a collective organ with apolyphonic structure, this is far too sophisticated for me and even a bit of a scam.Kiddies, don’t get upset by these moralizing tidbits, tit for tat.Strange are the ways of gods and men. I have been granted this award at thevery moment that I came down hard on Wiadomo´ sci, accusing it of passing overme in a silence worse than that of the red press in Poland. I came down hard onthem, but, as always, sincerely. Agreed, Wiadomo´ sci has spoken of me rarely in thecourse of the last few years, very rarely, here a mention, there a review, so itwouldn’t look as if they were treating me on equal terms with other writers. But it isobvious that an émigré literary periodical is not a bureaucratic window taking careof customers waiting in line. A publication like this is supposed to support freePolish art—to preserve its inﬂuence—to publicize the artists’ successes in the world—and all the more so if they are repressed in Poland. If not for Kultura, not a lamesoul would have known that I had done something for the sake of Poland.Never mind. I am glad that in recent issues Wiadomo´ sci has begun to treat1963615me well and I must admit that editor Grydzewski gave proof of great restraint inpublishing a positive article and other equally friendly notes about me with trueEnglish phlegm in spite of how ruthlessly I expressed myself. My continuingrelations with this paper could be better or worse, or altogether good—this is up toit completely—but I, at any rate, will try not to handle anything with kid gloves.Honesty! Openness! Integrity! Feet on the table! This is the basis of social health!

In Paris, still blindly in love with Argentina, I felt Younger (which con-ﬁrmed the charming youthfulness of Argentina and my own youthfulness as alover). I also felt Younger as a Pole, I, an ambassador of younger cultures. Thus wasI fortiﬁed in my diatribe against the old age of Paris and pushed into nakedness.But personally I was getting on in years. And I did whatever I could, I, a writer, inorder to be older than the Parisians, more cunning, reﬁned, so as not to allow themto catch me being naive. . . . I pushed before them this youth prepared à la Paris,that is, old, with all the maturity I could stand.So in the end I no longer knew what I was: young or old? In this cacophonyI hit on more than one dissonance. . . .

I asked them who X was, whom I knew only thirdhand. They answered thathe was a well-known writer. I said, all right, a writer, but who is he? They explainedthat he was associated with surrealism but recently had devoted himself to aspeciﬁc objectivism. I said, ﬁne, objectivism, but who is he? They told me hebelonged to the Melpomène group. I answered that I agree to Melpomène, butwho is he? They responded that his genre was characterized by a combination ofargot and fantastical metaphysics. Then I said that I agree to the combination, butwho is he? To which they answered that he received the Prix St. Eustache fouryears ago.This was in a small but delightful culinary nook overlooking the Seine andI was downing a mouton that had a heavenly aftertaste. I suddenly understood mytactlessness: what do you care who your cook is, I mean you eat not him but hisdishes. Parenthetically speaking, this was tactless not just regarding cooks but616Volume 3regarding tailors, for the question ‘‘who one is’’ is by its very nature denuding (andantiphenomenological, to boot). After all, a French writer is not going to paradearound naked, there are thousands of coats ﬂoating in the air, you put out yourarm, grab the coat most to your liking, and violà, you are a romancier, historiend’art, a Catholic, or a pataphysicien . . . the air is swarming with techniques,directions, solutions, levels, platforms, the Parisian air is refreshing and light, like afurniture cart. This literature knows practically no raw material, it feeds itself ondisquisitions that succumb to further disquisitions. I shouted that I was neither awriter nor a member of anything, neither a metaphysician nor an essayist. I wasme—free, unencumbered, living. . . . Ah, yes, they said, so you are an existentialist.But my transoceanic nakedness, from over there, from the pampa, naked-ness that I needed for my love of Argentina (in spite of my age!), does not allow menot to be denuding with them. Something indecent was created. With what em-barrassment these hotshots accepted my passionately naive gaze, reaching themthrough their clothes . . . deadly discretion, discreet melancholy, tactful under-statement, were an answer to my desire from over there, from the peripheries of theworld, from the fatherland of the Indians. Dressed from head to foot, wrapped up,even though it was May, with faces fashioned by hairdressers . . . and each one hada small, completely naked statue in his pocket, for him to look at with the eyeof an expert. Modesty and discretion predominate. No one imposes himself onothers. Each one does what belongs to him. They produce and function. Cultureand civilization. Imprisoned in clothes, they can barely move, similar to insectssmeared with something sticky; when I began to remove my pants there arose suchconsternation, they bolted for the doors and windows. I remained alone. There wasno one left in the restaurant, even the cooks had run away . . . it was only then that Inoticed that, wha— —, my God, what am I doing, what is wrong with me . . . andgrimacing, I stood with one cuff on my foot, the other in my hand.Then Kot walks in off the street and, seeing me standing there like that, asksme, astounded: —Have you gone crazy? I am cold and ashamed and say that, yes, Iwas beginning to reveal a bit of myself but all of them ran away. He says: —You’vegone mad, you’re confused, who in the world would be afraid of your nakednesshere? Why, where else in the world will you ﬁnd such tearing of raiment . . . wait,you happened on rabbits, but I will invite such lions that even if you dance nakedon the table, they won’t bat an eye! Then we made a bet between ourselves, not a1963617modern but a Polish squire’s bet (I felt not Argentine but Polish with Kot becausewe had that shared grandmother), a late nineteenth-century sort of bet. Well, great.He asked the right people, intellects that undressed most brutally—I, nothing,until we got to dessert, when I begin to take off my trousers. They all scram, politelyexcusing themselves, pretending it is time for them to go! So Leonor Fini and Kotsay to me: —What’s going on? It can’t be that they got scared off, why they haveintellects that specialize in this kind of thing! I am very heavyhearted indeed,sadness is devouring me and I almost burst into bitter tears, but I say: —The point isthat they, you will notice, dress themselves even while undressing and their naked-ness is just one more pair of pantaloons. But when I just dropped my pants in nospecial way, they were ready to throw up, and mainly because I did not do it à laProust or Jean-Jacques Rousseau or Montaigne or existential psychoanalysis butjust for the heck of it, to take them off.

If you want them to go into raptures, you haveto recite Cocteau’s poem or show them Cézanne—then they go into raptures, theyassociate this with beauty, they salivate, or rather, applause appears on their hands.In this magic world, full of signs, symbols, slogans, rituals, ceremonies,formulas, gestures, I have had really strange adventures.I knew well, long before I arrived in Paris, that it was harder and harder tospeak here; one can see this from their books, which are more and more mute . . .618Volume 3but I did not know that it was true to such a degree! On the second or third day afterthe breakfast with Breza, I went to supper with a few writers . . . licking my spiritualchops, because these were ﬁrst-rate minds! The production of introductory condi-tioned reﬂexes—namely greetings, compliments—went smoothly and as long asthe conversation was carried on according to this reﬂex, everything went ﬁne, ajoke was told, I laughed and they laughed. Until ﬁnally, distressed by the dogs,choking on the laboratory dogs that were literally lunging for my throat and bayingin my gullet, howling in awful torment in their unending qui pro quo’s, I wanted tosay something. . . . God almighty, is my sin so awful, I simply expressed a so-calledthought . . . about life or art . . . as often happened to me in the Café Fragata inBuenos Aires. They went mute. They devoted themselves exclusively to eating andkeeping silent, keeping silent and eating took up the rest of the symposium. I wasaghast, I think to myself, what is this, have I offended them . . . but the next day Iwas at supper at Vladmir Weidlé’s and I tell him, how and what, over cheese, andhe says to me that no one in Paris talks anymore . . . that in Paris one talks to avoidtalking . . . he said, in example, that the annual banquet the Prix Goncourt jurymeets at a certain, fair, restaurant, and talks exclusively about food so as not to sayanything about art. . . .Sure, when a man loses the young man in himself forever, where will heget a little lightness, where the strength, that could stop him from endlessly gainingweight? So it is with them: an awful difﬁculty crawled into their articulation,someone might even want to say something, but he cannot, it’s too difﬁcult, toodeep, too high, too subtle . . . and each person pays homage to his difﬁculty with hissilence. I meet Butor at a party at the comtesse’s, I say to him that I am happybecause, well, when we are together in Berlin, we will talk ourselves out, even ifon the subject of the nouveau roman français. Instead of an answer, the leaderlaughed out loud—and this was a polite excluding laugh, completely hermetic, thelaugh of a can of sardines in the Sahara. . . . Good gracious!The genius of Paris does not stop its feverish activity, works and ideas areborn in the womb of the boldest of cities, racing at the very head today, just ascenturies ago . . . however, I would say that some sort of painful waywardness hasemerged between the city and its inhabitants, this genius is changing into somesort of antigenius, one would like to say that they are inhibited by their own bold-1963619ness, their courage frightens them, their rebelliousness makes them cozy, theirbeing above average casts them into the average . . . and so they walk around thisSpirit of theirs like ﬁeld hands tending their milch cows and selling their milk.Paris, yes, a palace, but they gave the impression of being the palace servants.. . . palace servants. In Paris, city of dogs who salivate if you honk, I hadwayward and perverse adventures. One night, while returning from a tasty bistrowith a good wine on the brain and seeing the open gates of a palace alive with theloveliest baroque lines, I think to myself . . . I’ll drop in . . . and I dropped in . . . andthere were ballrooms, sculpture, bas-relief ceilings, a coat of arms, and gold leaf.Then a small man appeared, well dressed but so modest that I thought he must bethe majordomo or a valet. I ask him to show me the rooms and he calls his wife,sons, ﬁrst one son comes out, then right afterward another, then a third, they showme everything very politely, wherever they have to they dust, blow, touch thesculptures, paintings, sweep, brush off . . . it was only at parting, when I reachedinto my pocket, that he said, ah, no, I am the prince, this is my wife, the princess,my son the margrave, the count, and the viscount. I said good-bye to them in asilence that resembled stagnant water.I went out into the street and walked for a long time until I ﬁnally reachedthe statues in the Jardin des Tuilleries—in the evening light the soft and curvingnakedness of the statues surrounded me, swaying and ﬂuid, graceful, slender,then . . . except that it was of stone, stone cold, a paradox, I confess, because it wasimmobile movement, lifeless life, hard softness, cold warmth, and this is how allthis lives lifelessly at night in the moonlight. . . I think to myself what magic is this,what a paradox . . . and here the paradox expands, stiffens, and outgrows itself . . .and I thought that it would be best not to stand here too long in this paradox,between statues, it would be better to leave. . . . I began to leave, slowly at ﬁrst, thenfaster and faster, but there were lots of statues, a stone forest. . . . I dodge, I turn . .and then I stood there as if changed into stone. Dogs before me! I look: it was amarble Actaeon who, having seen Diana naked a moment earlier, now ﬂed . . . buthis own dogs were after him, baring their teeth, their fangs, they are upon him, theyare biting him to death! . . .But how awful! The mortal sin of the daredevil pursued by dogs, ﬂeeing,did not move at all. . . . And it went on, like this, without respite, for eternity, like a620Volume 3frozen stream. And in the encounter with petriﬁed sin Pavlov began to howl, all theway to the outskirts of Paris . . . and Pavlov howled piercingly in the still night!I went home.

The plastic arts are invading their literature more and more—one can seethis in the criticism, the genre is being applied to a literary work straight outof painting exhibits and galleries. In the plastic arts epochs, styles, movements,overshadow the artist’s individuality (which can express itself inﬁnitely more freelyin words than in pictures)—this advantage of the collectivity and abstraction isalso apparent in literary criticism. The plastic arts are closer to a thing than to aman; the painter or sculptor fabricates objects and therefore one approaches aliterary work like an object. The catalog is overwhelming the critics; the mostimportant thing is cataloging, including in a group, in a movement, criticismbecomes more and more objective, there is more and more theory in it, the critic isless and less of an artist and more and more of a researcher, expert, scholar, andsource of information.Critics of painting or sculpture must write about them as about somethingbasically alien and external, because painting values cannot be grasped by meansof the word, the word and the brush are two separate disciplines. Criticism ofliterature, on the other hand, is words about words, literature about literature.What is the result? That a literary critic must be an artist of the word and acocreator; there can be no talk of ‘‘describing’’ literature the way one—unfortu-nately—describes paintings. One must participate in this criticism; it cannot beexternal; it cannot be a criticism of things.But ever since they strangled youth in themselves with its sacred inclina-tion to embrace and attract, their world becomes more and more external. That is,objective. The nouveau roman français is also a melancholy resignation fromhumanity in favor of the world, there is no poetry in it. . . .Or, rather, this poetry is too one-sided. It is a poetry deprived of exactly thethings that make up the poetry of youth: charm, which attracts and disarms. It doesnot know how to, does not want to, appeal . . . it lacks lightness, ease, originality,that which does not distinguish and specify but fuses and blurs. . . . And this youngpoetry is attainable if the writer knows that he is a writer—for young people as well.1963621That all literature is also a literature for young people. That an adult also exists for ayoung person.Beauty, poetry, produced exclusively among ﬁfty-year-olds, forty-year-olds . . . hm, what? Heck if I know. It would be better if all phases in our develop-ment played in us at once—this would be real music! It is difﬁcult to producebeauty in isolation from the age at which man is beauty.Otherwise the works will have all the possible virtues except one: attractive-ness. They will lose the secret of attracting. It will be competent and repulsiveliterature.French literature or literature in general? I keep confusing Paris with theworld.

Genet! Genet! Imagine! How embarrassing! That homosexual attachedhimself to me, kept following me, I go somewhere with acquaintances and therehe is on the corner, somewhere, under a lamppost, beckoning or something . . .sending me signals! Just as if we were out of the same mold! Shame! And also—thepossibility of blackmail! Before leaving the hotel, I looked out the window . . . hewasn’t there. . . . I leave . . . there he is! His huddled shoulders gape at me!It was only in Paris that I got acquainted with Genet. In Argentina I knewnothing about him. I am emphasizing this because it is important that peopleknow that my Pornograﬁa, whatever else it may be, is a spontaneous birth and notconceived from a romance with Genet. About a week after landing on the streets ofParis, I was given his Les pompes funèbres.I open it. First impression? This is from the war, the years 1939–45; this isthe most perfect extract of that awful taste. I have never read a book that was more‘‘wartime.’’ Second impression? People, he fused ugliness and beauty into one622Volume 3angel, in his work both look out with the same eyes, what impertinence, whatheroism! Third impression? Brilliant France, once again you have come up with asafecracker who, using a crowbar, opens doors locked with a key—you astound andhorrify me! The fourth? Poetry! The ﬁfth? He, the hoodlum, did a good job ofsnifﬁng out a ﬁreproof safe with unheard of but forbidden wealth! The sixth? Oh,how difﬁcult and unavoidable this is, like a dream, like Golgotha, deriving fromdestiny and connected to fate. . . .The seventh? It seemed to me that it was I who brought out Genet, Ithought him up just the way I thought up scenes from my books. . . . And if heoutdid me, then he did so as a creation of my own imagination.But I felt confused . . . this brotherly soul was, hm, compromising . . . Notjust, however. This hand which tried to touch me in a forbidden way under thelamppost was so cold!In spite of this, I could not get myself to look through other works of his andI gave even Les pompes funèbres a rather cursory read. What do you want, tele-phones, meetings, turmoil, and so it passed. . . . I did not read it carefully. I did,however, buy Sartre’s study of Genet, Saint Genet, comédien et martyr, a book of578 pages, and in my free time I devoted myself to the seesaw Genet-Sartre, Sartre-Genet. But I didn’t read Sartre carefully either, although his existential psycho-analysis is equal, to my understanding, in terms of the amount and quality ofdiscoveries, to eleven or twelve Prousts. What do you want, this is how it workedout. After all, you know that books are not read carefully. I read the way everybodyelse does.During my reading the question arose: what is it in Genet and in Sartre’s in-terpretation of Genet that I have to defend myself against the two of them, againstGenet himself and against Sartre’s Genet? What makes them repugnant to me?After all, this poet shook me up. As for Sartre, it was with delight that I sawhow, in his understanding, Genet the pederast loses his separate, ‘‘abnormal’’character in order to merge with ‘‘normal’’ ones in profoundest humanity: some-one who, like everyone else, merely ‘‘became’’ a homosexual and ‘‘became’’ acriminal the way others ‘‘become’’ sports ﬁgures or merchants. The humanity withwhich Sartre treated Genet’s inhumanity, that disarming of the demonic in a study,leading the demonic to ecstasy, seemed to me a considerable intellectual achieve-ment. Yet I could not resist the impression that Sartre was taken in by Genet. Fine,1963623according to Sartre, Genet turns against his own freedom in an act of free choice bychoosing a self that is a ‘‘thief,’’ ‘‘pederast,’’ and ‘‘bad guy’’—an act that conﬁrmsfreedom as much as it negates it—and a dialectical process emerges whereby thatwhich is aimed against one’s own freedom leads being to general ruin, beingbecomes a phantasmagoria, the internal contradictions of Evil, which ‘‘is’’ nega-tion enabling even Evil to exist . . . and thus Genet recovers his freedom throughnothingness, freedom that he has renounced and along with it, the world. Fine. Yetthis reasoning, without losing the ground under its feet for even a moment, some-how, somewhere became suspended in a void . . . why?And why did the Genet who announces that he chooses Evil and wantsEvil arouse as many doubts in me as a cutthroat telling tall tales to a prosecutingattorney? Someone allowed himself to be taken in. Sartre by Genet? Genet byGenet? A surprise of sorts crouched on the other side of the menacing gatesallegedly leading to hell. No, it was not hell but something else. What? Easiness.Listen, how easily, how simply and unremarkably, everything happened: this boy,Genet, began to steal because he had to get money from somewhere; and hebecame a pederast by following the voice of his body. And this, too, happenednormally, smoothly, gradually, in a million imperceptible moments of existence,no longer from minute to minute but second to second; smoothly therefore; in andof itself; in carelessness; in irresponsibility; in the ﬂurry of life; among companions,equally easygoing. As for Absolute Evil, he attached it to his existence only afterbeginning to write when more advanced in years and it was necessary for literature.It was only then that he announced that he had chosen Evil; but he did not addthat he had chosen it ex post. And Sartre’s study was not an interpretation of hisexistence but merely an interpretation of an interpretation . . . he got busy onGenet’s life only after it had already been mythologized by Genet in his art.With what ease the diabolical temple has come tumbling down; and it hastumbled down into facility.Someone else, I assume, would be disturbed by this; how is it that every-thing gets explained away so easily? I knew, however, that this was not a coin-cidence and that if there were something that could trip up the two of them, Genetand Sartre, then it was this ease—as if it were the most insurmountable obstacle.What ﬁnally pushed me away from this poet who, like me, tried to makethe highest good of young beauty and put a twenty-year-old on a pedestal?624Volume 3Why, he did not grasp youth, at its most profound—its essence is disarming;it is relaxation, inadequacy, something that can never attain full existence andthereby is something transitional, which simpliﬁes and absolves of sin. For him itwas a crime—cruelty—sin—holiness—torture . . . this monk, sinner, saint, crimi-nal, and executioner approached it with knife in hand to make it frightening and tothrust it into extremity.How characteristic that in Paris, the capital of the world, the most brazenattempt at deifying youth ended by casting it into hell—into sin—into morality, andso into culture. Not for a moment did Genet allow it to loosen up whole centuriesof French morality; on the contrary, he took it to its greatest power and rigidity,turning a supple hazelnut tree into murderous steel. And to this youth, concoctedby old age, Sartre applied his even more mature analyses. . . . O Paris! Are you andSartre and Genet and I and all of us ever going to be able to take a break from thatrockier and rockier road to Mastery? Never even once look back? O Argentina! Isthe past unattainable? I will add something more to erase the melancholy pathos ofthese last sentences. I saw Winczakiewicz. I spoke on the radio. I met AntonioBerni on the Quai de la Tournelle.6251964

I landed at Tegal airport in Berlin on the sixteenth of May, one year ago.Professor von Bonhard, a representative of the Ford Foundation, put me andmy suitcases into his beautiful black car and drove me through the city. Me—justanother piece of baggage. I landed in front of some building, somewhere in a park,elevator, corridor, room; large with an enormous window, stairs from this room tothe top, where there is another room, balcony, bed, wardrobe, unpacking, table.I went out on the balcony: rectangular blocks of ﬁfteen-story buildingsin lush greenery, a city-garden. I wallowed in these spaces after my Parisian hotelcubicle.Ingeborg Bachmann, a poet from Austria, also invited by Ford and alsoliving in the same Akademie der Künste, was the ﬁrst person I made friends with.We took walks, both somewhat amazed, or stunned by this island (in a Communistocean), or perhaps by something else, we had seen little, almost nothing, I recallthat I was amazed by the lack of people in Berlin—when someone appeared in thedistance we would shout, ‘‘Oh, oh, a man on the horizon!’’ In foreign, distantplaces one is visited by a difﬁculty in seeing, in discernment . . . this has to doespecially with unusual, exotic places. . . . I remember, once on the Upper Paraná afull moon crawled right up under my nose, a few steps away, I pinched myself invain, the luminous bubble over the water was right there and it was the moon, andyou could put as much effort as you wanted into explaining to yourself that it wasnot like that but it was that way . . . the difﬁculty in getting our bearings thataccompanies us everywhere, in our own homes, in a room, becomes more andmore insistent, as one or more anomalies lend this place the character of some-thing coded. Why did Berlin seem practically empty to me in those ﬁrst days? Ilived in a neighborhood in a park, but I was also driven around all the main streets.626Volume 3I don’t understand. Fata morgana. After a week I noticed there were quite a fewpeople in Berlin after all.After the confusion of Paris—blissful calm, blissful silence. A holiday. I amwalking in the Tiergarten in the May sun and squinting. Nothing urgent to do,except for a few visits—then Professor Höllerer drove Miss Buchmann and me toWannsee, where we were ﬁlmed. A few interviews. Vacation. And the coagulatingof all that is behind me. Argentina, the journey, Paris, all is anaesthesized. . . .It was then (while walking in the Tiergarten) that I caught a certain scent, amixture of herbs, water, stone, wood bark, I couldn’t say what exactly . . . yes,Poland, this was Polish, just like in Ma™oszyce, Bodzechów, my childhood, yes, yes,the same, why, it wasn’t too far away now, a stone’s throw away, the same nature . . .which I had left behind a quarter of a century earlier. Death. The cycle wascoming to a close. I had returned to those scents, therefore, death. Death. I hadcome across my death in various circumstances but there was always some sort ofmissing each other that gave a perspective on life, meanwhile in the Tiergarten Icame to know death head-on—and from that moment it has not left me. I shouldnot have left America. Why didn’t I understand that Europe meant my death?Why, for a man like me, for someone in my situation, any sort of getting closer tochildhood and youth has to be deadly—and even though later ‘‘I was amazed’’ thatsomething as delicate as a smell could so suddenly bring my life to a close, fromthen on death sat on my shoulder, like a bird, throughout my entire stay in Berlin.And, at the same time, the period in Argentina, which was over, took on amythological glow. While walking in the Tiergarten, I was recovering from obliv-ion the incredible moment when I, a 1939 Pole, found myself in Argentina, alone,alone on land lost in oceans, like a ﬁsh tail reaching the south pole, oh, theloneliness of Argentina on the map, its disappearance in waters, its being pushed tothe bottom, drowning in distances. . . . Alone, lost, cut off, alien, unknown, adrowned man. My eardrums were still being assailed by the feverish din of Euro-pean radio speakers, I was still being assaulted by the wartime roar of newspapersand already I was immersing myself in an incomprehensible speech and in a lifequite remote from my former one. Which is what is called an uncommon mo-ment. A silence like that in a forest, a silence such that one hears even the drone ofa tiny ﬂy after the commotion of the previous years, makes a strange music—and inthis ripe and overwhelming silence, two exceptional, singular, speciﬁc words be-1964627gan to make themselves audible: Witold Gombrowicz. Witold Gombrowicz. I leftfor Argentina accidentally, for only two weeks, if by some quirk of fate the war hadnot broken out during those two weeks, I would have returned to Poland—but I didnot conceal that when the door was bolted and I was locked in Argentina, it was asif I had ﬁnally heard my own voice.Twenty-four years of this liberation from history. Buenos Aires—a camp ofsix million people, great camp ground, immigration from the entire globe, Italians,Spaniards, Poles, Germans, Japanese, Hungarians, mixed, temporary, from day today . . . And the native Argentineans spoke freely que porquería de país (swinishcountry) and their freedom sounded terriﬁc after the stiﬂing fury of nationalists. Itwas pure pleasure in those ﬁrst years, knowing nothing of Argentina, knowingnothing of the parties, programs, leaders, newspapers, to live like a tourist. If thistourism did not leave me barren, it was because, luckily, as a writer used tomanipulating form, I could undertake the shaping of my person from this newposition, in this situation . . . but wasn’t Argentina one of my predestinations, sinceas a child in Poland I did everything I could to march out of step in the parade?The muniﬁcence of enormous waters whipped into eternity which dividedme from European history! And then suddenly . . . a return, the move to Europe,and this into a place that is more bespattered with history than ever, into the mostpainful place. I was ﬁguring out, I knew, that all this would not go smoothly, thatgenerally this entire trip to Europe had become something much more dangerousfrom the very ﬁrst than I could have foreseen when I was packing my bags inBuenos Aires. Something very desperate has been mixed into this journey. Butwho could have known that death would ambush me in the Tiergarten. A joke?Platitude? Sure, joke and platitude, but the kind that do not give up easily oncethey have sunk their claws into you. . . .

I was still mulling over Paris, thinking about Sartre.Who is more provocative—Sartre or Voltaire’s Pangloss? It is a little likehaving smoke rising from ruins and crematoria to the appropriate height andforming the words ‘‘freedom.’’Never mind about the war and concentration camps—a proclamation offreedom like this would be a provocation always and everywhere. To try to con-628Volume 3vince us that we are free, we, victims, martyrs, slaves, up to our ears in disease,addictions, desires, always in the rat race, drudgery, fear, panting, cowed? We areexperiencing the most hideous slavery from early morning to late at night . . . andhere Sartre talks about ‘‘freedom’’! It only deepens the irony that the thought mostat odds with our daily experience turns out to be quite reasonable and fertile in itsvarious repercussions.Can a philosophy whose starting point is consciousness have much incommon with existence? Consciousness, as such, is something indifferent to life.Life knows only the categories of pain and pleasure. The world exists for us only asthe possibility of pain or delight. Consciousness, if it is not the consciousness ofpain or delight, has no meaning for us. I made myself aware of the existence of thistree, and so what? I couldn’t care less. Conscious being is no being—unless mysensitivity registers it. Not conscious being but felt being is important. Conscious-ness then must be the consciousness of sensitivity, not the direct consciousnessof being.But pain (and thus pleasure) of its very essence contradicts the concept offreedom. To say that we have the slightest possibility of freedom in suffering (whichwould be tied to the sense of purpose delineating our system of values, even if itwere only freedom ‘‘in a given situation’’), one has to scratch the meaning of theword. Suffering is something I don’t want, that I must ‘‘get through,’’ having nochoice is its essence, that is, a lack of freedom. It is hard to come by greateropposites than suffering and freedom.Assuming that existentialism’s starting point may be only sensitivity, I there-by exclude all existential philosophy that is the philosophy of freedom.I write about Sartre to get away from Berlin. It is obvious—never write‘‘about Berlin,’’ ‘‘Paris,’’ only about oneself . . . in Berlin and Paris. . . . I will notallow my writing to digress from the subject. But ever since I left Buenos Aires andcame to know the wide world, it is harder to concentrate on myself, I, an Argentin-ean, corrupted by the South, saturated with its sun and sky, now walking underheavens whose shapes and lights have been lost in me. . . . I immerse myself inshrubs, or moss, reﬂective, excited, snifﬁng like a dog . . . that sharp northern skywith its scuttling clouds, space, time. Nothing over my head except speedinginﬁnity. I once wrote that after arriving in Argentina, I experienced a kind of sec-ond youth, and this second youth somehow killed that other, ﬁrst, Polish youth . . .1964629all that over there, Bodzechów, Ma™oszyc, my school years in Warsaw, my literarydebut, cafés, was over in me, it fell away. So? What now? To ﬁnd in oneself, out-side the vastness of the heavens, this entire cast-off enormity, to drown, dissolve init as well? In the meantime Berlin began to take on the features of a city not all thateasy. . . .I had no illusions, of course, as to my German—but that all this should beso malicious! I saw the malice I am talking about when a certain ofﬁcial invited meto supper. Other people who spoke English were also asked, whereas I conversefreely only in Spanish and French. Every once in a while they turned to mepleasantly but it always ended in mimicry. Then one of the people present reachedfor the German Ferdydurke lying on a shelf and began to read some of its passages.This was very nice of him. But . . . I hear myself speaking, those are mywords . . . but I do not understand . . . I see that I am speaking and that theyunderstand, but I do not understand. . . . A strange split, as if I were merely thecorporeal complement of that written Gombrowicz—and then I felt that my exis-tence here must be incomplete and . . . and . . . rather physical. Which frightenedme. But this is not my point, not my point. Should I go to Poland? This questionbegan to plague me on the ship. In Paris they tried to talk me into it, go ahead,what’ll it hurt, you will see how many friends you have. . . . And it was enough toget close to the windows for the northern sky, dark and boiling with clouds, to beardown, confound it, for my prehistory to bear down on me from all sides, fromcolors, ways of walking, boarding the bus, the caps, the German smile which wasright next door to a Polish smile. To go? Or not to go? I would not be journeying toPoland but to myself as I was . . . and this I feared a bit. It meant nothing thateverything there had been turned inside out and was unrecognizable—I wouldhave found myself. But I could not handle this, the whole Argentine period waseluding my grasp too handily when the slip sailed away from Buenos Aires, I wastoo lost. . . . A great opportunity, oh, pencil pushers, to shout in chorus: —Such isthe fate of an emigrant and egoist! Nonsense. The fate of any person, at a certainage, whose life has split into two parts. To peer into that moldy well where I wouldsee my ten-year-old, sixteen-year-old, and twenty-year-old face and go to the ceme-tery to dig up the grave where I lay . . . and at the same time to greet my family,friends, exchange views, participate in social gatherings?630Volume 3Lost in such thoughts, inundated with fears (because ever since leavingArgentina I am stalked by anxiety) and with this death, encountered in the Tiergar-ten, I began my life in Berlin. After a two-week stay in the Akademie der Künste, Iwas moved to a comfortable apartment on Hohenzollerndamm. I unpacked andarranged my things. During this time I became acquainted with almost all theleading writers and editors (Berlin was hosting the cream of German literature),with whom, unfortunately, I could not always converse. Günter Grass, Peter Weiss,Uve Johnson, my fellow writers, spoke poor French. Generally, after a twenty-ﬁve-year absence, Europe seemed to be a Tower of Babel. Sometimes six differentlanguages were spoken at a dinner for ten people. Airplanes ﬂung people around, Iknew people who had three apartments, one in each capital—Rome, Berlin, Zu-rich, let us say—each for ten days per month. This new, modern Europe wasimpossible to grasp; it was too fast, galloping, I held it in my hands like a bomb, Ididn’t know what to do with it. But this is not my point, not my point. West Berlin,divided by the infamous wall from the East, has a little over two million people andoccupies an enormous space in proportion to its numbers, bestowing parks, lakes,forests, every instant; some neighborhoods are so sunk in trees that one does notknow, buildings or forest. City-spa, the most comfortable of all the known cities,where cars move smoothly without trafﬁc jams and the people move smoothly,unhurriedly, where crowds and stufﬁness are almost unknown. An unusual idyllin the air: older men are tenderly walking their well-groomed dogs, a neat womanwaters ﬂowerpots on the windowsill, cars stop politely at trafﬁc signals, a worker isunloading packages with a smile, someone is eating a pastry on the café veranda, alovely, pedigreed maiden is window shopping. . . . politeness. In the elevatorsstrangers are exchanging bows and courteous words. If you ask a passerby for astreet, he will take you there, going out of his way. In conversations one hears atone that inspires trust, as if lying, irony, and malice had been banished from hereforever. An immeasurable correctness appears in collars, ties, ﬁngers, ﬁnger-nails, shoes, in the way taxis drive up, in the way clients are waited on, in thegesture of the postal clerk, in choosing the correct stamps or sticking them on yourletter. A deep morality in the eyes, and in the whole body, in the outline of a hatdown to the shoes. congeniality, serenity, and good will permeate the city,whose living standard is higher than that of the United States. beauty often looksyou in the face, reticently northern and strong. In the city, nerve center of the1964631world, island, and with a wall to boot, one sees practically no police, one can walkfor miles without seeing a uniform . . . in this green spa, in idyllic Berlin. . . . Butthis is not the point, not the point. I ate my suppers in a garden restaurant onFehrbelliner Platz: serene, trees, umbrellas. Sparrows, which no German everchases, sat on my table and pecked at whatever they could get. Two fountains,parrot-bright with constantly changing colors, like two bouquets in the area of thetables, among the conversing guests, the bustle of the waiters. And every so often itwas red’s turn, and then I, in innocent Berlin, thought of blood and blood spurtedfrom the pitiless earth! But this is not the point, not the point. Berlin . . . no, this isnot easy, perhaps it would be easier if,—oh, Hamlet!—I didn’t have bad dreams. Agood six months after living on Bartningallee, and eating my breakfasts in therestaurant on Hansaplatz, I had the following experience. Across from me, a fewtables away, sat a German, an older man, with trembling hands, probably retired,with a tankard of beer, a little touched in the head maybe, but movingly sociable—he greeted the waiters, me, and other guests with great warmth, enthusiasticallytook advantage of the least opportunity to speak out or to gesture with his arm, hisloneliness must have been great . . . (was it from over there, I, the ahistorical one,asked). He always turned to me with particular relish: —lovely today, eh? . . . (longpause) . . . what snow! . . . (ﬁfteen-minute silence) . . . a cigar perhaps? . . . Once weleft together, it was Sunday, he said that, you know, on Sunday excursion busesleave from here, perhaps we could take one? . . . I said, no, thank you. He looked,silent, ﬁnally he said his hands were trembling, he said something in German, ofwhich I understood only bits, just scraps: —not to go . . . to go . . . not to get there . . .the various things that could happen . . . one cannot, there is nothing, nothing,there is nothing, what do you want (was wollen Sie?) . . . ganz unmöglich, impos-sible, why this cannot be (das kann nicht sein) . . . too bad, too bad (schade) nothing(nichts) . . . nein . . . aber sehen Sie, mein Herr, das ist viellicht trotzdem, undgegenüber . . . He ended emphatically: —Nichts. And thus he stood, somehowcontradicting, resistant, stubborn, steadfast, and elusive, categorical, resigned, des-perate, wavering, soft, hard, dramatic, decent, with something on his lips . . . with acomplaint . . . protest . . . negation, perhaps emptiness, perhaps nothing. . . . I, onthe other hand, stood, unable to understand, grasp, ﬁgure out, I stood over thesewords as if I were standing over a pile of scattered blocks . . . or over a hole fromwhich blew denial. . . . But this was not the point, not the point. So what then?!632Volume 3Since leaving Argentina, I have lost the thread—and here, in Berlin, too manythreads crisscrossed—there were houses, streets, trees, lawns, asphalt, I stood in allthis, he was babbling something, I don’t know, death, mine or theirs, was brushingagainst me again, I have to go home, smile, bow. . . .

Lady Macbeth. They keep washing and washing their hands . . . (forstarters).Faucets. Bathrooms. Hygienic washing . . . yet.The length of legs and a certain paleness in the eyes and the neck and thecolor of skin . . . egoistic . . . (But Swedes, for example? Norway, Holland?)Waiters. Ballet. Rock. They never suffer. They are without blemish. Cour-tesy. (The German as actor.)Do they like masks and games? (One can come at it from this side, gener-ally, unfortunately, everything is possible).Seclusion. They work well together, that is, they give of themselves onlypartly, within the context of their functions. Their loneliness is devoured by theirtransformation of the world and by satisfying their needs. They marry early. Toemploy the woman, to harness her to work. . . .The North, the North . . . How much of them is in them, and how much issimply the North (the English? Swedes? Danish?). The answer to this: Northerncharacteristics grow stronger and change in their mass, incredibly compact. Andﬁnally they change into wings. Irresistible! (One can do it this way. When one manthinks about a few dozen million . . . he can do anything. . . .)A German left to other Germans.A German condemned to Germans, that is, in its simplest version: whomshould he trust if not his engineer, general, thinker? German work has always beenvery solid. Germans, here is a nation where the worker puts his trust in the elite,and the elite places its trust in the worker. . . . It is true that they lost both big wars,but they kept the whole world in check, and until they were trounced, their leadersled them from victory to victory. In spite of everything, they are accustomed tovictories: in the factory, in war, in carrying out all their assignments . . . Hitler, too,was a matter of trust.1964633Because they could not believe that it was so coarse, they had to accept it asbrilliant. . . .Parallel: a Pole informed by defeat, a German—by victory.They are not more capable, just more afraid of what is slapdash—which isalien to them . . . (the face of an electrician, ﬁxing the wires in the elevator,attentive, painful, almost martyrlike).Etc., etc. One could also take the line of arbitrary, accidental comparisonsand see what comes of them. . . . For example, eyes—eye sockets, work as a variantof the camera, being reduced to eating, the relation movement-rest, or, for exam-ple, what is always behind them when they walk . . . (one could say a great deal; andthe beneﬁt is certain, that this would preserve me from the same, eternal, sche-matic concepts in which they are boxed up . . .).Not to inform oneself.Not to read, neither books nor newspapers.Not to look at the wall.Not to get too interested in anything.To sit in the café and stare at the street. . . .

No, I am not writing about Berlin, I am writing about myself—this time inBerlin—I have no right to write about anything else. Do not lose sight of yoursubject!I recognized other artists invited, like me, by the Ford Foundation. I had afew ﬁne suits made for myself. I was ﬁnishing up the chapters of my diary that dealwith my journey to Argentina and my stay in Paris. I was ﬂooded with invitations:concerts, exhibits, colloquia.It seems, however, that That Thing from a quarter of a century ago causedme, a somewhat ahistorical newcomer from across the ocean, the most sleeplessnights . . . or thrust me into sleep. . . . The idyll went hand in hand with a certainmonstrosity, which one could not identify for certain as today’s monstrosity oryesterday’s—because, in the ﬁnal analysis, today comes from yesterday. Berlindogs, for example, are ultra correct, one after another, yet I did see, maybe some-634Volume 3where deep down, dogs emerging, dogs that had assumed a monstrous appearance.Every once in a while a little word no less horrid was uttered and also stretchedbetween yesterday and today—did I imagine, for example (because this mixing oftime gets into your sleep), that someone said to me, ‘‘You know, here somewhereclose by is a hospital where cripples too awful to show to even the closest familymembers are kept locked up. Their families are told that they died.’’ People say:There on the other side of the wall was Hitler’s bunker (was, or is? Because it still is,though as a former bunker). People say: Oh, the war, those were bad years! Or: Ihave been alone since the war, my husband and son died then. I was driven to theprison and shown an ordinary, bright room with iron hooks in the ceiling—used tohang people who fought against Hitler—but maybe not to hang but to strangle(because I didn’t understand all that well, sometimes I didn’t even hear well, ashappens in the mountains, on great rivers, in places where nature become fantas-tic). And again: This ‘‘was,’’ or ‘‘still is’’ . . . although not quite, already eroded byTime. But I had to see on the streets of a city so decent, so deeply moral, not justmonstrous dogs, but people-monsters, for who could guarantee that the right footof this man of a certain age did not once effectively crush someone’s throat? Theirastounding strength in overcoming their past sometimes makes it hard to be-lieve. . . . In this city the whine, the howl of an idiotic dog, a macabre dog, is unitedwith an appealing will to normalcy.The scene of crime or virtue? I, a person from Argentina, rather ahistoricaland inexperienced, kept having the feeling that Berlin, like Lady Macbeth, wasendlessly washing its hands. . . . And, in these conditions, the generations begin-ning life, that enormous revivifying and purifying wave, starting from somethinglike the beginning, inundating the past, took on a distinct meaning—but thisGerman youth constantly eluded my understanding because our lame dialogues, abit in German, a bit in French, did not allow us to really get close to one another.Of all our meetings, the one most vivid in my memory is celebrating the New Year1964 in a certain young painter’s studio, where I found myself because of my Greekfriend, Christos Joachimedes. When I stepped into the half-lit, split-level studioand saw northern youth, laid out on couches, standing in corners, I immediatelynoticed their conﬁnement to their own hands, the hands were strongest, they ﬁlledthe room as they grew denser or thinned out, strong, large, clean, with carefullytrimmed nails, civilized. And the heads accompanied the hands, the way a cloud1964635accompanies the earth (this was not a new impression, once earlier Roby Santuchoin Argentina had also pushed himself down for me, knocked himself down, towardhis own hands).Criminal hands? Of course not, these were innocent hands. . . . New andnot the same, yet, the same after all. . . . What was the difference? Not the sameeyes, hair, lips, the same laughter? The golden-blue blond fellow cordially gave mea glass of whiskey but this hand reached out to me from over there, eyes from overthere looked at me. . . . Someone else put a hand on my shoulder and this wasbrotherly, but fraternity from over there was death. . . . I don’t know, friendly ormaybe hostile. . . . And at that moment a lovely girl shrugged her shouldersplayfully, it was love, love, yes, but that over there was also love, a forest, a forest ofarms stretched before them in a conquering gesture, lovingly, heil, creating hands!Idiocy! Away! Imaginings! How Europeans (I did not meet this Europe even inParis), calm and easy, not a pinch of chauvinism or nationalism, broad perspectiveson a world scale, yes, this was the most modern youth, I had the opportunity tomeet. They did not even deny the past, one could see in the half-light that that wasnot their affair, they were something else, something new. To tear away! ‘‘Comeon, let’s go, what do you need their Achilles for?’’ A generation, given birth to by noone, parentless, without a past, in a vacuum, except for their being bound to theirown hands—which hands, it is true, no longer killed but were merely occupiedwith graphs, bills, fabrication, production. And they were rich . . . extrastrangejackets, beautiful watches . . . their cars parked in the streets. . . .The luxury, therefore, of boys highly civilized, in the very heart of Eu-rope . . . nevertheless, murderous associations exploded in my brain every minute.In order to ﬁll a gap in my German gobbling, I quoted Goethe’s Hier ist der Hundbegraben and immediately some sort of buried dog got in my way, no, not a dog butsome sort of contemporary, the very same one who could lie somewhere aroundhere, close by, over the canal, under houses, here where young death must havebeen thick in the last battle. This skeleton was ﬁxed somewhere close by. . . . At thesame time I looked at the wall and saw there, high up, practically right at theceiling, a hook ﬁxed in the wall, ﬁxed into the bare wall by itself, tragically, nothingcould be worse than that hook, there, pounded, a hook, the wall, high up, pounded,into the bare wall. Could the luxurious and European young people, isolated andself-sufﬁcient, ﬁgure out what I was thinking? I knew that they did not want to be636Volume 3‘‘Germans’’ with me, just as I did not want to be a ‘‘Pole’’ with them—and perhapseven, who knows, they did not want to be Germans at all, cast into the world,beginning from the beginning, hungering after the widest horizons. Yet the hookremained ﬁxed in the wall! Whiskey. Wine. Sandwiches, cakes, fruit. Conversa-tions and ﬂirtations. One always talked about something else, Brecht, Grass, studios,travels, Lessing. My curiosity grew as midnight drew near . . . what will they do withTime? What will they do with the New Year? What will they do with the momentwhen the Past tears into the Future? And so? The hour sounded, the corks shot outof champagne bottles, and they, with smiles, wishes, hugs, blurred the dangerousmoment. Are you going to Greece? Did you see Benrath’s exhibit? Piers Read is inEngland. You will see that by next year, I will be a Frau. New Year in Berlin turned out to be perfectly serene, bourgeois, without Time, actually, and without History.They were, therefore, private individuals. And I, who always strained to bea private person in life, could not applaud this. Citizens of the world. Europeans.Except for that hook pounded into the wall, pounded, pounded . . . only thisfraternal skeleton, death close by . . . and only hands, that elusive advantage ofhands. . . . I gulped down one more whiskey! There, then, at parades lovinglydeadly, the hands of this youth were thrust before them, oh, a forest of handspassing by and leading forward . . . they marched with their hands . . . here, how-ever, now the hands were calm, unoccupied, private, yet, I saw them chained totheir hands, hurled into their hands.

German hands in Berlin . . . I have been stealing glances at them for a longtime . . . these hands disturb because they are more efﬁcient, more serious, I wouldsay, all German work realizes itself better. . . . But the complete emptiness, thedeadly silence of these hands, became obvious to me only when I spotted them atthe party, among the orphaned young people in the city rebuilt from ruins, withoutcharacter, that is a temporary . . . island. . . . None of them had anything to latchonto. Goethe’s great German tradition was too compromised by what happenedafter it. The slogans of the new Europe were not lively enough. After all, they—now—were afraid of slogans, programs, ideologies, bah, even morality, that scrupu-lous German morality which led to diabolical escapades. So what then? Work. And1964637I knew that each of them has something to do, something concrete, exams, theofﬁce, shop, painting maybe, or literature, production, fabrication, technique, theyproduced it and, in producing it, transformed it, and this designated for them forthe time being and while it lasted their meaning, function, role . . . in the empti-ness and silence of hands . . . in this odd Berlin. I saw German youth as a blowaimed at the outside world in order to ﬁnd out who one is—as the remaking of theexterior to gain ﬁnally, along this road, the awareness of its own I. But how manytimes have the Germans struck at the world like a battering ram in order to get atthis secret? I repeat: what crushes one in contact with them is the consciousnessthat one is playing for keeps here: this is by no means a secondary nation, but onein the forefront and thus actually making its way blindly, not imitating but creat-ing, innocent, because it is entering virgin territory. Here one does not know whatone will be or even what one can or cannot be. Oh, their exoticism, their hermeti-cism (even and primarily when they give of themselves), their own content thatcannot be expressed, the self-control that has the character of madness, that hu-manity, being an introduction to some sort of future, unknown humanity, their‘‘functionalism,’’ owing to which ﬁve of the most ordinary Germans become anunpredictable whole . . . this is not so simple. . . . Wait! Wait! Trust in God, notin your dreams! The hands of these young people were perfectly still, private,what did they want? A car, wives and children, promotions . . . that is why theyworked . . . they wished to live their lives as decently as possible, that is all.The hook? The cadaver nearby? The forest of hands? These were only my com-ments on them.And really one does not know what to grab hold of: for I have never seenyoung people more humanitarian and universal, more democratic and decent andgenuinely innocent . . . calm. . . . But . . . with hands!

Strange and beautiful: those calm heads, thoughtful eyes, punctuality,peace, good humor . . . yet at the same time all of this is careening into the future,galloping away. A German is a slave of Germans. A German is run by Germans. AGerman is magniﬁed, pushed, given wings and momentum by Germans. But thishappens quietly.638Volume 3In the half-light I saw how they were in relation to one another, sideways orhead-on, how the German density was created, and I knew that there, ‘‘amongthemselves,’’ they were rather merciless . . . or just defenseless. . . .Production! Technique! Science! If Hitler became the curse of that genera-tion, then how easily science can become the defeat of German youth. Science,fusing them in abstraction, in technique, can make anything of them. . . .Were these boys in a position to discover and understand their predicament—if it didn’t ﬁt into their daily schedules?

Let us imagine that I will ask one of them whether he likes jam? He willreply in the afﬁrmative. But if he had replied in the negative, it would have beenthe same. . . . For his needs, tastes, preferences, are the result of his reliance onother Germans, the consequence of a ﬁgure they compose, all together, at a givenmoment. They change their taste between themselves.

When I went out onto the frosty street at dawn, the New Year was fading inBerlin, cars were returning full of people, still in a festive mood. Calm was reap-pearing and sleep . . . in the city, full of wallets, watches, rings, ﬁrst-rate sweaters . . .with a lost past and future.But everyone already knew that tomorrow the city would begin workingagain, in higher gear, in a tempo that quickened with each passing day, and thiswork was solid, normal, as if nothing had happened, bringing better and betterresults . . . healthy work. . . . Comfortable streets with rows of trees, sturdy, plump,peaceful houses. . . . Berlin gives the impression of someone walking evenly, surely,except that it doesn’t know where it is going. What will they do? I asked myself andthe word ‘‘do’’ meant both ‘‘do for themselves (produce)’’ and ‘‘do to themselves.’’Ah, newcomer from the pampa, aren’t these judgments a bit too swift and hasty?Why, all of Europe, since I landed in Cannes, seemed to me to be blind withwork . . . I had not met anyone who was not a function, a cog in a wheel, all thelives were interdependent and the brilliance was conquering, mad, it discardedman to become the incomprehensible vibration of the human masses at fullthrottle. Goethe? Instead of Goethe—mastodons of factories, no less creative. Ex-1964639cept that Berlin, suspended in a void, condemned to its own vibrations, had goneone step further. . . .During my entire stay in Berlin not one Goethe, Hegel, or Beethovenpresented himself, nor anyone that might even remotely resemble them. Therecertainly was no lack of ﬁne, technical talent, but that spiritual brilliance escapesfrom the people into a product, into a machine, plays in the hum of transmissionbelts, there they are brilliant . . . outside of themselves.Their health! Their balance! Their afﬂuence! Oh, how often this made mealmost laugh, what a joke, what a historical prank, that here, in the very center ofcatastrophe, people are living so comfortably and earning more than anywhereelse. How comical that they were able to get out from under so many ﬁery anddestructive bombs—as if nothing had ever happened, ruddy and with overnightcases and bathrooms to boot. . . . Infuriating! Where is justice . . . and commondecency!But it would be good to understand and remember that this ascetic andreligious (even if God disappears) nation splits up into two meanings, two realities.Suitcases, overnight cases, electric shavers—yes, all this spoils and tickles them—but at the same time all this elates and spirits them away. From what? Towardwhat? The question is neither easy nor triﬂing. At any rate one would do well toremember that for them luxury tends to be sacriﬁce, and petit bourgeois calm aﬁerce tension, and that when they stop gently during a snowy bright noon in frontof their displays meditating on what else to bestow on themselves, it is exactly then,somewhere in the mountains, in their deserts, that pressures are born, avalanches,and in the thrust, the toil, in the din and slamming, in the roar of all the rotatingcogs, the new step into the Unknown is being taken for them.

I want to write as far away as I can from politics. . . .Which perhaps is dumb, as the swift economic rebirth of the FederalRepublic affected the fate of all of Western Europe and has become etc., etc., etc.All this is obvious. And the snow falls, an enveloping whiteness, which I had almostforgotten, the silence of whiteness, its drowsiness, stubborn, falling slowly, blur-ring. . . . Sleep. Sleep. Instead of my being an alert observer here, I prefer to tell mydreams. I am sleepy, my sobriety is also a kind of sleep, sometimes as if I were640Volume 3waking, I begin to speak more to the subject, but then immediately one, two ﬂakesof sleep-inducing snow fall on my brow. . . . I have been asleep ever since I leftArgentina—and even as I write this I have not yet awakened. Snow. Sleep. If theseare supposed to be my observations . . . then I want them to be relaxed by sleep asmuch as possible.

Max Hölzer, a poet, and I at a table at Zuntz’s. On the other side of thewindow a refreshing whiteness and the sleepy neons of Kurfürstendamm. Hecomplains, speaks, bah, bah, the devil take it, where has our genius gone, the deviltake it, we had so many people in philosophy, in art, who generally did not deign tonotice anything outside the greatest issues of being, the most basic, and today, I askyou, where has this race of grands seigneurs gone to, our literature keeps rehashingthe war and Hitler and politics, nothing but democracy’s settling of accounts withdictatorship, this is what brilliance has been reduced to. . . .Dusk and cars, whiteness and cars. Hölzer is a disenchanted descendant ofGoethe and he says Hitler, yes, Hitler, Hitler constantly blocks the panorama, thisnarrowing, this limitation, this red cape at which the German bull strikes. . . . Iagree with Hölzer, I think that the brilliance constantly present in the highest—former—attainments of these men on pedestals, these grands seigneurs of theGerman spirit with unmatched panache, irritates today, torments, humiliates. . . .Göttliche Funke, bah, bah, but how to be brilliant when one has so many matters toattend to, the telephone, radio, press, exchange of services and production, dailyproduction, in which they’re stuck like ﬂies in a spider’s web. . . . And they are likethe victims of some sort of unremitting action surrounding them . . . in bombarded,destroyed, hastily rebuilt Berlin, in the hurrying, makeshift Berlin where the wall,where past and future are shattered . . . on this island that was an ex-capital. . . . Thisliquidated place demands some sort of novelty on a big scale, tailored to Germanidealism, German music, but there is nothing but telephones, activities, cars,ofﬁces and work, only that growing, all-encompassing spiderweb. Sometimes atseven in the morning I was awakened by a cannonade, I saw from my ﬁfteenth storyhow antiartillery rockets burst in clouds on the red side, I saw the wall and Ameri-can helicopters, British soldiers, suddenly the tension grew, since they again shot1964641the daredevil who tore like a madman through the empty strip separating the wallfrom Western checkpoints. So History then? Why no, not this is dangerous inBerlin but the calm course of everyday activities, only the everyday and the triﬂeare diabolical.But what about that brilliance? I asked about Heidegger.The answer was . . .—His inﬂuence is slight, it is limited to professors, to this day his prewar tiesto Nazism have not been forgiven.So politics then.Many movements, many activities surrounded us in this café—which waslike all cafés except that German movement and German activity are as if made ofsteel. Someone was eating ham. Waitresses. A dozen or so men walked in, thebustle increased, a few tables were put together.—And those people . . . Who are they?—Specialists.—In what?—I don’t know.—Fine, but what is that corpse doing here, that young skeleton sitting withthem. . . .—Corpse?—Well, yes, he’s ordering a gin and soda.Hölzer was not absolutely certain, he asked out of courtesy, ‘‘What corpse?’’but ﬁnally he agreed with me.—Even if there was some sort of corpse sitting overthere with them—he explained diligently—then you must consider that they, asspecialists, are not really all that present here themselves; one could even say thatthey are absent, because ultimately a specialist really exists only in his specialty,thus their absence somewhat softens the presence of the corpse who, to put itmildly, is with them and is not. He was saying this slowly and perhaps with a certainreticence or doubt, I looked around the hall and I had to admit in my soul that allthe people here really were . . . and were not . . . for while sitting here over coffeethey were, however, somewhere else, each in his own specialty, his own ofﬁce. InBerlin, however, this incompleteness of existence (allowing for a mirage, fatamorgana, perversity, and other abuses), with which I had to deal so many times inPoland, in Argentina, had in itself all the seriousness of German technique and642Volume 3labor, Trust in God, not in your dreams, perhaps they were not so very real, butthey were becoming real . . . real therefore in their effect but unreal in theirexistence? I have no idea. But perhaps this is not the point? . . .—Oho—said Hölzer—There is Höllerer, he’s looking for us. . . .—Are you sure—I asked—that Höllerer really came in and is here and islooking for us? . . .—Of course—he replied, somewhat irritated—why you know very well thathe is supposed to take us to a Lesung at the university.

Sure enough . . . Höllerer walked in, Höllerer the professor, the specialist,art theoretician, chief organizer of cultural life, editor of the important quarterlyAkzente and of one other, even more specialized, publication devoted to, as far as Iknow, quite speciﬁc experimental research having to do with certain subconsciousmechanisms of articulation! It is always indecent on the part of an author tointroduce real persons into a half-real text like this one—even if he graces themwith the warmest praise—and this simply because the author can do with themwhat he pleases, like God; they, on the other hand, become his creations, with noright to protest. I hope, however, that my Berlin friends—Hölzer, Höllerer, andothers—will want to pardon this indecency of mine (which in this instance is evenmore blatant, considering that I was a guest of the city and a guest of the FordFoundation) of the type that he who knows he is not supposed to eat ﬁsh with aknife is allowed to eat ﬁsh with a knife. It is enough that Höllerer, after having adrink with us, did in fact put us in an automobile and drove us to a Lesung in a neighborhood I was not familiar with, a garden, in it buildings and trees, every-thing comfortable, the students’ cars occupied the free space of the park, wewalked into a sizable auditorium, sat on the dais, Höllerer as the chairman, Hölzer,Mr. Berlevi, Miss Ingrid Weikert, Klaus Völker: before us were rows of chairs, onthem students, their diligent, calm heads, applause. —What’s going on?—I asked,unfamiliar with the word Lesung.—Nothing big. You will read passages from your books in German translation.—But my pronunciation . . .—Won’t hurt.—But I won’t understand what I am reading—and they won’t either. . . .1964643—No problem. You are a foreign author visiting Berlin, so this is merely acourtesy on our part, and also something prescribed by international culturalcooperation, not to mention the enrichment and enlivening of our curriculum.Then Hölzer will read a few of his poems and a discussion will follow.

I thought in a ﬂash about the situation Höllerer and I found ourselves in.He belonged to those people who inspired trust, I did not doubt that as a professorhe must be an excellent professor and as an organizer an excellent organizer,German competence beamed from his eyes, movements, words. . . . I knew that Ihad found myself in competent, efﬁcient and reﬁned hands. But Höllerer had yetanother quality—that he was as much a student as he was a professor, he had, thiswas evident, the cheerful soul of a fraternity brother. If you approached a buildingthat was holding a party attended by Höllerer, you could hear his resonant studentlaughter coming out the window from quite a distance. It was this liberating laughthat I was expecting now when, obviously, he could not take my predicamentseriously, faced with these students, this Lesung, the pointlessness of this undertak-ing was certainly obvious to him. . . . But, by dint of that—so German—division ofroles, he lost the student in himself when confronted with his students. He becamenothing but the professor and he sat on the dais ready to begin the session. Pleaseunderstand my situation. I was at the end of my tether . . . perhaps not of mystrength as of reality. . . . From the moment I left Argentina behind, Europe wassucking me dry, the way a vacuum sucks people dry. Lost in countries, cities,crowds, I was like a wanderer consumed by mountain perspectives. Having landedon a city-island, a city-chimera, I sensed my own death in the Polish scents of theTiergarten. Weakened by this death from the inside, I had to deal with the hiddendeath of the city, which meted death and got it. And how difﬁcult my whole lifewas made here, when at Zuntz’s I had tried to articulate my thoughts, give some-thing of myself, when I participated in the multilingual international receptions,suppers, when I attempted to tear through the strange fog, the mists of this strangeland, this theater wrapped in clouds like a mountain, truth never grasped, un-deciphered hieroglyph. Yet, at the same time, and as if against the grain, the realityof Berlin, the reality of each scene, each situation, seemed more and more sin-cerely solid—oh, this talent of theirs for actualization based on nothingness! Let us644Volume 3take, by way of example, the scene that now took place: no way around it, theLesung will now happen as solidly as possible, everything, beginning with thewindows and door knobs and ending with the students’ heads, showed evidence ofgood work, oh, the heads of the students, diligent, thoughtful, calm, oh, theirrobust, healthy bodies, armed with notepads and, oh, Höllerer at the dais like achoirmaster! My only hope, therefore, was his laugh and I, Ferdydurke, at the endof my journey, could count only on his juvenile laughter, his student’s easy laugh,exploding everything to smithereens! Forget it! The roles had been assigned. Thesituation was organized, it broke up into students and the professor.

AndI kept waiting for an explosion of the professor’s unbridled student laughter toliquidate the session, destroy, explode, but Höllerer, for reasons unknown to me,and probably the most perfectly German, did not abandon an iota of his solemnity.But I was already too exhausted in my existence, I had to defend myself, Idid not want to die, I decided therefore to give a sign of life, but how, what could Ido here, the discussion was droning on . . . and suddenly, just as I was with myGerman, I stammered something, asked to speak, intruded into the discussion,began to orate.I speak to a full auditorium, they listen. The brazen irrelevance of myjabbering was immediately incomprehensible, I lost my train of thought, I wasthreading together haphazard words, just for the sake of talking, just to get these,the words took sharp turns, threw me here and there, shaken, rolling, grasping forwords, drunk, madman, idiot, incomprehensible to them, to myself, I talked andtalked, and the more nonsense I uttered, the more violently I spoke and gesticu-lated without rhyme or reason. And I see to my horror that the audience, led by theimperturbable Höllerer, is listening to me! Yes, the diligent, calm, unperturbed646Volume 3heads of the students listening to me steadfastly, I would say, and my anarchyfalling into their most calmly alert will to order, sense, organization. Nonsenseaccepted as sense! Madness momentarily transformed into something normal.Were they then ready to accept into themselves all the madnesses of the world inorder to mold them among themselves . . . so absorbed in themselves that there wasno lack of restraint that could upset them?Berlevi?I felt that I could no longer speak like a drunkard to this German rock. Buthere, a few chairs away, was Mr. Berlevi, a Varsovian, after all, a prewar futuristfrom Ziemia ´ nska, from Lourse’s, bah, a fellow Pole, a little more relaxed, some-thing of a crack in this pitiless homogeneity, something like a door slightly ajar, likesome sort of softening . . . and I could sneak out this way. . . .I turned right to him and passionately made incomprehensible accusa-tions, I came down on him hard, I got into some furious polemic beyond theboundaries of sense, somewhere in the absurd. This, on the other hand, sank intohim like into a pillow, slowly both our heads were overcome with drowsiness andBerlevi fell asleep ﬁrst, I immediately afterward, just like after vodka, in a bar,where one talks just to be talking in sweet oblivion, it was or wasn’t, one more shot,who cares what time it is, one more! . . . One more! Because you feel that only a to-subepidermal quieticization of agglomeration conceived antropoidally pour losedrink what three already let’s go right away the surrealism of sociology that bottletwaddle well then let’s ass-im-i-late these here schnapps schnapps schnapps.Yes, unfortunately! Both Berlevi and I drank ourselves into unconsciousness.Meanwhile applause broke out, the students were rising, Höllerer thankedHölzer and me with a short speech, the Lesung was over. I stood up, thanked himwith a bow, and also began to leave but my leaving began to stretch itself somehow,I kept leaving and leaving but I could not leave, I wanted to scream, I could not, Idecided to turn to someone to complain that, what is this, I keep leaving andleaving but can’t get out, but no one was left, strange—I thought—what a citywhere activities stretch out like gum and are like traps. Just then I spotted Höllerer,he stood by the wall, his laughter tucked under his arm like a briefcase . . . and hewas different somehow. I looked a little closer . . . he was heavy . . . heavier thananything I could imagine, as if made from the matter of those dead, concentrated1964647stars, like bullets in the dark corners of the cosmos, I thought, uh oh, what now,why is he like that, what has happened? . . . And he stood and weighed, standing hisweight . . . weighed. . . . And a little farther away stood Senator Arndt, who wasalways very well disposed toward me, or rather it was a variant of him and soremoved from the real thing that, actually, it was and was not him. . . . I thought,they know how to ﬂee from themselves, however, far, far away, and the earthslipped out from under my feet; in the frenzy of pride, in a surge of power, I foundmyself somewhere in the solar system and I thought oooo, what’s this, a few blazingﬁery masses zoomed by in fury and passsssed; crying, despair, sobbing could beheard. Could it be, I thought, could it be, how careful one must be with them, thisis clearly no earthly race, it seems that earth is not enough for them, neither earth,nor man, they have higher aspirations. . . . Sobbing. Despair. Sorrow. Then I sawthe likable and young Mrs. Kurpiers, but through a telescope in the incomprehen-sible distance, and she also looked at me through a telescope and cried through thetelescope and said oh, please understand our pain and our suffering, we mustconstantly go and go and remove ourselves from ourselves and throw ourselves intospace, which does not end, which is unearthly, which is beyond. . . . Enough.Maybe even this is boring. I ﬁnally succeeded in extricating myself from this andreturned to my beautiful apartment on Bartningallee, across from the Akademieder Künste. I threw myself on the bed without undressing and fell asleep.

N. told me (he was not alone) about the Americanization of Berlin. Hesaid: —We needed America so badly after the debacle . . . and its spirit even morethan its military force and dollars. America slid over us like a steamroller, leveling,democratizing, simplifying. We liquidated our remaining towers with bannersproudly waving, our entire metaphysics, all of romanticism, fog, high clouds, andin exchange our feet touched earth, and the concreteness of ordinary life andordinary activities were revealed to us.I did not mention a word about my experiences . . . as described above . . .which would conﬁrm instead that reality in Berlin does not belong to the moststable and crystalline of realities. . . . Oh sure, everything on the surface is, I repeat,extraordinarily solid . . . but there are basements and in these basements reality gets648Volume 3into their hands like a laboratory rabbit, like rubber which one forms and almost,one could say, changes itself into something produced like any other product.

Eva Bechmann was saying to me: —Nothing calms a person after Paris likethe view of a Berliner drinking coffee on a café veranda on a summer’s day. He andhis coffee are something like the absolute.Sure. Except . . . are they really people? Sure, they are—and very human—but at the same time they are people in some ways unlimited, almost no longerpeople but creatures for whom the form ‘‘man’’ is only an accident and a temporarystage. I would not trust the Americanization of Berlin too much, either. Theexpiration in this generation of the race of grands seigneurs making breaknecksomersaults into the Abyss of Existence does not calm me in the least. On thecontrary. The fact that Hegel is resting quietly in the cemetery in East Berlin is noguarantee regarding the absolute of coffee, cakes, or men’s or women’s ready-madeclothing. If I were coffee or cake in Berlin, I would not feel too sure of myself.

Their metaphysical anxiety no longer ﬁnds an outlet in the consciousnessof brilliant individuals and wanders aimlessly, like an exiled ghost, seeking expres-sion in combinations of people, in combinations of collective life, in forms supe-rior to the individual.

Yes, but while a Frenchman works to make something,they work for the sake of the work itself.I would even be inclined to assume that their appealing material accom-plishments became possible because this is not what they were very interested in.1964649How much of what is occurring to me stems from my illness? How muchfrom Berlin’s illness? This city is in some ways so like me that I no longer knowwhere I end and it begins.

I missed having an artists’ café in Berlin, something like the Ziemia ´ nska orZodiak in prewar Warsaw. The editor J. liked this thought, so we decided to beginour doings on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the Café Zuntz, and we informed ourfriends and acquaintances. At the beginning there were lots of people; it seemedthat slowly the traditions of famous Berlin cafés of this type would be revived.Foreign artists invited to Berlin by the Ford Foundation also dropped by, and ofGerman writers, Günter Grass, Uve Johnson, and sometimes Peter Weiss. . . . Thisdid not last long. After a few months everything was reduced to my table, whichlasted a little more than six months before it vanished. . . . I assume that if thisinitiative had been more theirs, internal, less international, it would have beensustained somewhat longer—but probably not much longer. It seemed to me thatthey generally did not want to give of themselves, they did not need an exchange ofthought or any other kind of exchange, each knew his thing and what he knew heexpressed in what he produced: books, articles, paintings or other activities. Therewas a general skepticism regarding any direct contact not within the framework of aspeciﬁc assignment. Their eyes met but always about something, never in the waythat eyes look deeply into other eyes.

Professor Hasenclever invited me to a chat with his students—with thestudents of the Literarische Colloquium. They impart rather strange knowledgethere: how to write, how to become a writer. Young people who feel God’s call toliterature study the technique of composition there, and artistic expression, de-scription, action, the devil knows what exactly, maybe even the technique ofinspiration. A beautiful villa on the Wannsee as well as the splendid quarters in thecenter of town constitutes the setting for this speciﬁc experiment, the only one ofits kind. Veni, vidi . . . , and I said primo that if they want to be writers they shouldtear out of here through the doors and windows, secundo that they not allow Butor,who will lure them with the little wonders of the nouveau roman français as well as650Volume 3other theories, to lead them astray. Both Professor Hasenclever and his studentsreceived my counsel with great satisfaction (as far as I could tell), not to mentiondelight. This is really strange: they are all in science, in technique, up to their ears;scientism intrudes even into those areas that have formerly been the refuge ofhuman freedom, yet I hear their liberating laughter all the time, and I feel that theyare somewhere, somehow, my allies.

Butor was immeasurably good to me: he visited me when I was recoveringfrom my various ﬂus—I paid him back with attacks, aimed at his dearest artisticcredos. Ugly? But I believe that if every artist must be, even though he may notwant to be, a dramatic phenomenon (because art deepens), then even the momen-tary contacts with artists cannot be like a lukewarm and nauseating soup. Joyce’saccursed progeny! Cursed like him, they who slowly, imperturbably, cultivateliterature for literature’s sake, exalted, esoteric, supported by a group of initiates,while I am bored, faint, while I dry up!But not just Butor and not only Berlin. . . . To me all of Europe seems like ahorse that steps into a horse collar voluntarily. . . . Obedient, submissive, full ofgood will toward theory, constructive, positive, methodical, cerebral. . . .

Barbara Swinarska, wife of the theater director, comes to visit me right afterarriving here from Poland. She gives me a beautiful rose and says that she wants toget to know me, have a talk. . . . Lovely. I have had visits like this before. We go toa café.The conversation turn to the psychology of the Germans. It seemed to methat Mrs. Swinarska was somewhat simplifying a psychology on which volumeshave been written, which is one of the key issues of modern times—because it isdifﬁcult to deny this nation virtues and talents, nor can one deny that these virtuesand talents led them, in Hitler’s time, to the edge of night. Mrs. Swinarska says thatshe knows best, I know less, because I was sitting in Argentina and did not experi-ence the Germans on my own hide; I did not see them at their bloody work. I say,1964651well, you see, I don’t know, if it is a question of penetrating someone’s soul—theexperience itself is not enough, one needs intelligence, perspicacity, one mustimmerse oneself deeply in another man, or in a nation, and that in addition to this,a lack of distance often makes understanding difﬁcult . . . and it is possible thatPoles, after everything they suffered, are not always in a position to approach thepsychology of Germans with a sufﬁciently cool objectivity. . . .Gab, gab, gab. And what do we have here? She is offended? She felttouched to the quick that I did not trust her intelligence? . . . enough that I createirritation, which has plagued me a thousand times before, especially with women.She thinks that I am pufﬁng myself up, treating her nonchalantly, that I am a‘‘writer’’ and therefore treat her condescendingly . . . and I, on the other hand,seeing Mrs. Swinarska all rufﬂed, saying things less and less to the point, addsomething nasty. She says good-bye and leaves in a state of positive irritation.In a few weeks I receive a clipping from Cracow’s iZycie Literackie. This is a little piece by Mrs. Swinarska entitled ‘‘On Distance, or a Conversation with theMaster’’ which describes our meeting. I appear in it as a ridiculous coxcomb andantipathetic egotist, as well as Narcissus of course, a blithe spirit and the fruit ofdecaying capitalism. Here are a few excerpts from this characterization (I quoteverbatim):
I, the ridiculous coxcomb: ‘‘Why don’t you tell me why I know how to write theway I do?’’‘‘Because you are talented.’’‘‘Talented! I am not talented! I am not talented but I have awareness!Do you understand? Awareness. Because I know what others do not. BecauseI can understand everything!’’I, the egotist, commercialized to boot, the Ford stipendist and guest ofBerlin:‘‘You know, I have a Ford stipend here, $1,200. And I don’t have to payanything for my apartment because I am a guest of the Berlin Senate. InSpain it is cheap to live. I’ll buy a little house.’’‘‘Do you have to write anything while on the stipend?’’‘‘Have to? No. This is simply a stipend that recognizes a writer’sachievements.’’652Volume 3And so forth. After this introductory ‘‘dilution,’’ it was not difﬁcult to put thefollowing words in my mouth (we were talking about war victims in Poland):
‘‘You are always priding yourselves in an immodest way on the number of yourﬁve million slain. It is clear that you have nothing else to say on the subject ofthe occupation. Poles are backwater nationalists. . . . It is only in Poland thatpeople talk about the atrocities that took place during the war. . . .’’Etc.
Let us note that this text is not completely fabricated. I did indeed talk toMrs. Swinarska about the mountain of corpses obstructing the view of Germany,and people know from other things I have said that I demand a revision of anexcessively spasmodic, in my opinion, Polish nationalism, bah, not just national-ism but outright patriotism (a revision not liquidation) . . . why, not too long agoZygmunt Nowakowski was shocked by this very thing when Wiadomo´ sci awardedits prize. . . . But how did we get from there to these provocative obscenities? Whena so-called journalist wants to do a hatchet job on a writer, talent consists of notchanging him too drastically, one has to, rather, shade in, misquote, add a littlehere, subtract a little there, and from out of nowhere the thinking of a decent manwho has tried his entire life to think quite seriously becomes swinish.Actually, I would bet that Mrs. Swinarska did not quite grasp the swinishnessthat trickled from her pen. I assume that though she may have felt a little uneasyboth in fashioning me as an amusing prig and insinuating that I was whitewashingthe Germans in exchange for Ford dollars, all but a second Goebbels; after writingall this it was not hard for her to believe that I did say something like this, ‘‘more orless.’’ Why, yes, a little misunderstood, a little she didn’t hear, and the rest sheimprovised in proportion to her growing outrage and conviction that she was de-fending the Fatherland. Besides, everyone knows Poland is a cheerful little country,especially those in the literary world shower one another with jokes and riddles frommorning ’til night, a giggle ripples through the whole nation . . . so what’s the bigdeal, she smeared Gombrowicz a little, that’ll teach him not to be so uppity! Who isgoing to pay any attention! My thesis, therefore, is that Mrs. Swinarska was, in herreactions, as indignant as she was jocular.Here, however, the venerable Ludwik Hieronim Morstin appears on thestage. He dashes off a ‘‘Letter to Gombrowicz,’’ which appears in iZycie Warszawy.1964653‘‘Today, in iZycie Literackie, I read Mrs. Barbara Swinarska’s interview withyou and I am so upset by it that I have decided to write you a few words. . . . I amquoting your words from the interview conducted by Mrs. Swinarska’’ (lengthyquotes follow). Further, Mr. Morstin takes me to task for my villainy. And inconclusion, he writes: ‘‘The most common form of human egoism is closing one’seyes to the misfortune of one’s fellowman so as not to disturb one’s enjoyment ofall the pleasures and allurements of life. . . . You, Sir, are not worthy of thename writer!’’This is really quite splendid and I would agree with Mr. Morstin entirelyexcept . . . wherever did he get the idea that there was an ‘‘interview’’? In Mrs.Swinarska’s article there isn’t a single word mentioned that would entitle one tothis assumption. Well, so what, he made a mistake. . . . A mistake? The article is sosatirical and malicious that a small child could not have taken it for an interview—it is so obvious. . . .Passons. These combinations of jocularity and high-mindedness do notamuse me and I would like to be brief. When the article attained the status of aninterview, it was no longer difﬁcult to see me as a real scoundrel. Trybuna Ludureprinted Morstin’s letter ‘‘because of the great timeliness of the message,’’ and inthe weekly Siedem Dni, they wrote, ‘‘Whoever has such a cynical attitude towardthe martyrdom of millions of his fellow Poles . . . is a man without a conscience.’’I sent a letter to these newspapers in which I state that Mrs. Swinarska’sarticle is not an interview and that it was written and published without myknowledge. And furthermore: ‘‘In my darkest dreams I could not have been visitedby the base intention of whitewashing or even making light of Hitler’s crimes inPoland, which I condemn sharply along with all decent people of the world. Therecannot be the least doubt about this, as I have expressed myself on this subjectseveral times in my Diary. I have the greatest respect for the unprecedentedsufferings of Poles during the last war.’’I also sent this letter to the Writers Union in Warsaw. The letter was editedso as to be as concise and as to the point as possible, without reference to anypolitical issue—a letter in which a Polish writer fairly well known to the world asksthat people be informed that he did not utter cynical ravings that justiﬁably in-sulted the feelings of Poles . . . this letter, of course, was not published.Someone from Poland writes: ‘‘People are talking about you all the time654Volume 3now, you are being discussed. This will not hurt you. You are not destined for themasses anyway, so it goes in one ear and out the other, but in the cafés there is a lotof talk, people are informing themselves and the truth about you is spreading.’’It seems so to me as well. There are already too many people informedabout me—through my books. One can agree or disagree with me, but I certainlydo belong to the most candid writers in Polish literature. Everyone knows every-thing about me, even if from my Diary. Here in Volume 1, for example, is astatement about Nazi atrocities in Poland: ‘‘I know the measure of those sufferingsand the measure of that lawlessness and I have no intention of evading them with‘concepts’ when a crime is being committed.’’And I have written more than once in this spirit and vein!D˛abrowska? Iwaszkiewicz? S™onimski? Others? What do people who knowme, people who have often sent me proof of their esteem, have to say about this?How will they swallow this article-interview and the correction in the wastebasket?
(P.S. The above text was written in November 1963 and immediately printed inthe Parisian Kultura. I have to add that my correction was ﬁnally published inthe Polish press—after several months had passed and I was appropriatelyhacked to pieces. Only iZycie Literackie printed it, after removing the date—sothat the readers would not notice the delay—and after cunningly providing itwith selected quotes from my Diary that were supposed to demonstrate that I ama monster after all. . . . It is not I who will be compromised in the long run by thispremeditated combination of quotes from a book forbidden in Poland and by theelimination of the date of the letter, in order to lead public opinion astray. . . .6551965

I will bet that the above Berlin memoirs will get into the paws of newspaperpeople; that politics will dance its savage Negro dance around them; that I, anartist, will be given up to the columnist. I, a man, will become the prey of editors,the scapegoat of publicists, the carrion of nationalisms, capitalisms, communisms,the devil knows what else, victim of an ideology that is more a mythology, and adecrepit, infantile, sclerotic, bureaucratic, and worthless mythology at that.

The triumph of Günter Grass; sales ﬁgures for the last novel are approach-ing 200,000 books sold. Grass’s humor: people were upset that he showed up atballs in a sports jacket, so he had himself made a hideously violet tuxedo that hedons to add chic to breakfasts and afternoon teas. Another feature of Grass’s hu-mor: he has no appetite for philosophy, so, knowing this, I steered the conversationto philosophy immediately. Grass—courteously leaned over, subtle, and discreet:‘‘I beg your pardon but my sister, who is present, breaks out into a nervous hackwhen people mention more than six philosophers at once.’’I would run into these three—Grass, Johnson, Weiss—from time to timebut these meetings were annihilated either by linguistic difﬁculties or by thepresence of third persons. I kept saying to myself, I have to have a talk with Weiss, Ihave to ﬁnd out from him, he will tell me. . . . As for Uve Johnson, he was pureNorth. A Nordic so northern that I determined many times that I would challengehim to a conversation that was something more. . . . Nothing came of it. We werehermetic, they to me, I to them, it was obvious from the start, nothing, absolutelynothing, and the best that we could do was to leave each other alone. A little likehorses grazing in a meadow. But also like possessive creatures, in a state of expan-656Volume 3sion, ready to devour one another at the ﬁrst opportunity. Once Uve Johnson cameupon me accidentally in the little restaurant across from the Akademie der Künste.He came up to me and with a kind of northern embarrassment mumbled some-thing that I ﬁgured out was a compliment referring to the freshly published Porno-graﬁa in German. I became embarrassed by his embarrassment; I muttered some-thing and the conversation was steered to the more usual topics between us, that is,pipes, buttons, and jacket lapels.The new Philharmonic, ‘‘Scharoun’s circus’’ as the taxi drivers call it, is yel-low on the outside, and inside there is a light, elegant, cascading of listeners towardthe orchestra from all sides. One hears this architecture well and one hears well in it.Karajan inaugurated it (no mean holiday) with a performance of the Ninth. Theorchestra is the pride of Berlin; it is ‘‘excellent.’’ I put ‘‘excellent’’ in quotation marksnot because I doubt it but because only specialists can say something about this; theremainder, thousands, have to take their word. More appropriate, therefore, wouldbe the formula ‘‘one listens to this orchestra as if it were excellent.’’ But art is a luxury,and thus our language, when one speaks of it, becomes luxurious. One says proudly,‘‘I can’t listen to the Ninth any more, I know it by heart.’’ But to tell the truth, about 9percent of the Ninth is known, even here in Berlin.The ‘‘excellent’’ Vegh Quartet, which I listened to on record so manytimes, is now before me on stage. Immersed in people after my solitary listening torecords, I do not listen, do not hear, I merely admire the entering and exiting offour gentlemen in tails winged with violins, and especially the acting of Veghhimself, who knows how to inspire his rotund ﬁgure with very strange torments.Szeryng at the Philharmonic, violin concerto with orchestra, painful, theinadequacy of the violin is grating, one sees the superhuman efforts of the ‘‘master’’in order to extract the songs, furies, madness from the strings . . . but someone who‘‘is not an expert in music’’ might say that one could barely hear. . . . What does itmean to be ‘‘an expert in music’’? It means: to sense with a critical ear the mostsubtle imperfections in the execution and to discreetly forget about the glaringdeﬁciencies when they pertain to—let us risk this metaphor—the chessboard itselfon which one plays. Difﬁcult and in vain: the sound of the solo violin is too weak ina large hall, even with the best acoustics. If even the piano barely makes it in thesespaces, then the violins become a dribble, completely as if . . . hm . . . And from thevantage point of a less ‘‘sophisticated,’’ that is, less professional, aesthetics, perhaps1965657it would be more tolerable if the artist would simply pee, rather than to see how allhis inspirations and his power, frenzied in his violin playing, are transformedinto . . . hm . . . dribbling. What degradation of the human spirit. But this, ofcourse, is too naive and too ‘‘unsophisticated’’ a view.I am inundated with invitations: exhibits, concerts, operas, performances,conferences, lectures . . . has Berlin decided to become Paris? The number ofBerliners who are ‘‘experts in art’’ must, in such circumstances, be growing at atempo certainly not less than that of the number of cars. But I have preserved mylongstanding antipathy for spectacles, I do not believe that long box-ofﬁce linescan lead anyone to art, one has to make it oneself, I want to see it not on stage butin eyes, smiles, lips, and speech. . . .Be careful . . . watch out . . . the young skeleton again . . . this young cadaverintruder! What do their current theaters mean compared to that theater; they gavethe world the greatest tragedy of the century, a performance so revealing it turnedeverything Europe could know about itself upside down and gave the European anew dimension—but it is not about the glare of that hell that I wish to speak butabout the young nearby corpse, with its young-corpse beauty. One student told methat he prefers to spend a few marks on the bus than to wait by the side of the road forsomeone to pick him up, because, as a rule, the older man at the wheel begins tooffer him his memories from the war—and this is boring, this is very boring! Why didthis irritate the student so much? Wasn’t it simply jealousy? Wasn’t he envious ofthat youth, its fraternity with death, beautifully cadaverous, poetically cadaver-ous . . . he, standing in line for various box ofﬁces selling poetry and beauty, he, thepassive spectator of recited dramas? Berlin is a political issue. Berlin is a cultural,economic, or metaphysical issue. But Berlin is also an issue of expoetry, poisonousas a young corpse, rapacious as a young corpse. Let us not forget that beauty belongsto the concealed but mighty motors of History. Let us take into consideration thatnot only does a girl tremble for her beauty but that this trembling is also proper toboys . . . thus this student, standing in line with his change purse, car, and ﬁancée,with his bourgeois-corpulent life that has settled down so much, is, however, poi-soned by the venom of that young horror-beauty; for the nostalgia to which he willnot admit for all the world. Let us note, in addition, that a German, as such, seems tobe a creature especially prone to hideousness as well as beauty. His liking for scienceand technology often thrusts him into absolute aesthetic insensitivity, into greasy-658Volume 3white, heavy, abstract pedantry, in glasses, with beer and a notebook—and again, inreverse, his immortal lyricism and romanticism surrender him to the Muses. Thusthis student standing in line to buy a ticket, where people sell an already prepack-aged poetry within the framework of a rationally functioning division into produc-tion and consumption, sometimes experiences a blank and furious revulsion, just asif he were buying a ticket to a bordello —and afterward, sprawled out, pleased withthe comfort of the auditorium, repulsive to a degree, he trembles, neverthelessfeeling the potency of his lips twisted with cold, fear, hunger, perhaps deported ontrains, and he—Narcissus—feels on his lips the kiss of his other, soldier’s lips.The older folks have their eyes ﬁxed on that thing . . . like ﬁshermen hop-ing to draw out of the dark and accursed water the reﬂection of that other . . .dangerous . . . naive face. . . . The younger people tremble, disturbed by theunderground closeness of their contemporary. . . . Which modern German poethas been tempted to express this poetry? I do not know a single one. And none ofthe languages ones uses today in Berlin, not the daily-life practical one nor thepolitical one, nor the language of theory, faith, morality, are in a position to burrowinto the subterranean place where innocent sin, hideous beauty, killed life, andliving death reside. And no beauty on the surface, driving a car, motorcycle,wallowing in a river, pole vaulting, going to the cinema, eating a sandwich, iscapable of deadening the sting of that beauty, which changes day into night.Concerts and exhibits—theaters and ﬁlm theaters—lectures and recita-tions . . . Sure. Modern. Rationalized, organized, more and more ‘‘scientiﬁc.’’Sure. But if you, O poet, want to get at the source, you will have to step down intothe underground. I would expect something from you on the order of a god withtwo faces.

I left Berlin after a year’s stay in May 1964, bereft of all strength—I wasbarely able to board my plane. Disease crouched in me from the very ﬁrst monthsof my stay, but it took the snows, rains, winds, and clouds of a northern sky, unseenfor a quarter of a century, to arouse and develop it. Two months in the hospital. Iwas a lousy guest.

I was weak during my entire journey to Europe. Therefore this diary wasalso just the encounter of my impaired, sickly existence—with the existence ofEurope; and my feebleness, my fatigue, must have infected . . . Oh! In vain did Ichallenge youth in order to extract myself from my inadequately existing existence,from my insufﬁciently real reality.After twenty-ﬁve years I sailed in, eaten away by time and space. . . . I lackedthe strength to overcome the stony foreignness of Europe. Throughout my years ofArgentine exile I tried as hard as I could to remain loyal to Europe, the secret prideof my writing was exactly this: loyalty to Europe. It was just that in Paris, in Berlin,I felt right at home, I, a European. So many friends. Readers. Such blandishments.Tenderness. Yet I was too weak physically, disease had sucked me dry. And I was stilltoo ﬁxed in Argentina. So that when Argentina recedes behind me, dissolves, theEurope rising before me is like a pyramid, Sphinx, and an alien planet, like a fatamorgana, no longer mine, I do not recognize it, I do not recover it in time and space.And it does not allow me, the enfeebled, to possess it.I felt lost, leaving Buenos Aires.I am lost.Return to Argentina?

Admit that in my Polish soul, postwar Berlin had to elicit a storm—ofrevenge, horror, sympathy, admiration, condemnation, fear, esteem, friendship,hostility—there is room for all these and for many more feelings. . . .660Volume 3But no, Berlin became a riddle of realization for me . . . and of unrealization.One thing dominated everything else: the creation, demolishing, warping,correcting, evaporating, mixing, intensifying . . . of reality.I had ended up in Berlin at the end of my pilgrimage in Europe, in a placethat is most real and most fantastic. The journey was taken twice: once on the map,and the second time within me. Berlin became my inner adventure . . . but Irealize this only now, gradually, in the course of writing. . . .

They treated me, as I have said, with great and impeccable hospitality andwith no less impeccable friendship—but no, not a penny’s worth of politics, non-sense, but a lot, I assume, had to do with my being a Pole. Obviously, as a Pole Iweighed on their conscience. They felt guilty.All for naught! For naught! Don’t be children, your smiles and all thecomforts you could offer me will not remove one single minute of the thousands ofPolish agonies, so varied, on such a broad scale of torments. I will not be seduced! Iwill not forgive!I did not forgive but something even worse happened to me. I, a Pole(because I did experience this ‘‘as a Pole’’), had to become Hitler.I had to take on all those crimes, just as if I had committed them. I becameHitler and I had to accept Hitler’s presence in every dying Pole and the fact that hestill existed in every living Pole.Condemnation, scorn, this is not the way, this is nothing . . . the eternalrevulsion to crime simply extends its life. . . . One must swallow it. One must eat it.Evil can be overcome, but only in oneself. Nations of the world: do you still believethat Hitler was only a German?

The view from my windows on the ﬁfteenth ﬂoor: the white ponds of abroad, slumbering park, about a kilometer beyond it the Kurfürstendamm, theZoo, the very center of West Berlin with an American proﬁle, pulsating, winking,blinding, neon lights appear and disappear, hosts of cars speed along the boule-vards, an electrical streak ﬂoods the horizon.From the second large window: gloom and mystery, an enormous silence,1965661beyond the wall spreads East Berlin, with long streets, sad street lamps. Chimneys,towers, blurring in the early dusk of winter, somewhere over there something isshining, I take my binoculars, a multistoried building, maybe on the hillside. . . .This bauble, West Berlin, the last coquetry of luxurious Europe—farther,dead silence as if it were no longer a city but an expanse, gigantic, as far as China. Ilook with concentration at the mute isolation of winter ﬁelds as if I were in thecountry . . . magic has hidden in this primeval space, of which we know that it issubject to universal and organizing thought, dominated indivisibly by the Idea.While West Berlin is a luminous blindness, organizing itself blindly withdisorder, on the other side, where there is night, space, earth, winter, darkness, theIdea has settled, dogged, silent. Raw. This annoys. Strange, perhaps painful, thatthe Spirit is there, not here . . . its closeness fascinates . . . but astounds, depresses,that it is more similar to the rising mists, the descending darknesses, the passingclouds, the successive seasons of the year, than to something that would be morehuman. . . .This primordial quality . . .—When one looks out a window, it looks gloomy. But, you know, in EastBerlin people are much more likable. . . . Friendly, kind . . . Disinterested. Not tobe compared with the West Berliner, who is materialistic. . . .—Aha, you are a proponent of that system?—No, on the contrary. The people are better because they live in povertyand are oppressed. . . . It’s always like that. The worse the system, the better theman. . . .

When I left Berlin in May of last year, I settled in Royaumont, about thirtykilometers from Paris. An abbey from the thirteenth century where St. Louisserved monks, from where apparently France was ruled for a while, powerfulGothic, four-sided, four stories, walls, galleries, arches, rosettes, columns, in apeaceful park with the green, mossy water of its canals and ponds.The building is half-empty—‘‘echo’’ refectories, halls, with august tomb-stones, Latin inscriptions—half-inhabited, for the cells of monks on the secondﬂoor, along with the cell in which St. Louis supposedly lived, were ﬁxed up forintellectuals and artists journeying from Paris. I was still sick. Something of aperiod of recuperation after the Berlin hospital, but somehow I wasn’t getting anybetter, I felt that the secret poisoning me was still in me, I was grousing, I was takingfeeble walks under chestnut trees, I walked sluggishly to the road, to the bridge, Isat on a rock, I looked at the expansive silk of sweet France—dales, meadows, hills,along which were high voltage lines, set on steel towers, transparent, rhythmic. I1965663looked at this dejected, with a reluctant soul, like a dog’s snout turning away from afull dish, and slowly I directed my steps back toward home, entered the thickness ofwalls, Gothic vaults.In the morning while shaving, towel around my neck, I saw people slippingthrough the park: a professor toting a lawn chair to a secluded place, two subtleladies with umbrellas, a painter looking into the canal, a student laden with booksin the grass. Every few days foreign-speaking groups intrude upon this peace, forexample, sixty biologists, forty ethnologists, seventeen parapsychologists (I saw thisfrom the window), since Royaumont is an important scientiﬁc-cultural center, aplace of international congresses, also lectures, concerts, seminars. At the begin-ning I thought that it would not be bad here for me, I preferred this to the boredomof an ordinary hotel—and not being able to live in Paris (because Paris has becomean automobile apocalypse, howling, roaring, speeding, stinking), I was happy thathere I would have a combination of the delightful greenery from the Café Florewith the Sorbonne, bah, with Japan even, with Australia.And when, on the ﬁrst day, I entered the small dining room reserved forregulars and members of the cercle, I was greeted with cheerful shouts—because,as it turned out, Alan Kosko used to spend time here not long ago working on theFrench translation of my Diary and various linguistic problems were discussed atthe time. I heard from many people: —Kosko tormented us with your diary!Presiding over our meals was Monsieur André d’Hormon—a still ratherdistinguished old man, ‘‘diplomatic counselor and political adviser’’ in his day tothe Chinese government in Peking, a man who spent forty-eight years in China(and was, as rumor had it, the empress’s lover). China had washed over himwithout a trace; he looked as if he had never taken a step out of the Quartier Latin;a connoisseur of cheeses, eater of salads, worshiper of Anatole France, Zola, andRenan, Monsieur d’Hormon was also quite deaf, which did not stop him frommanaging the conversation with a true French cordialité. —Who is that gentle-man?—he would discreetly ask his neighbor at the table whenever someone newappeared. —That’s editor X, professor Y, poet Z!—his neighbor would shout intohis ear. —And this man is a writer. A Pole, well, well, could you tell me which ofthe modern French authors you value most?—Sartre!—I shouted. —Who? Sartre?Sartre, ce n’est rien du tout, mon ami! And do you like Racine? —Oh, not at all!—Ishouted.664Volume 3—What? No? But listen here a moment: . . . Quoi! Pour noyer les Grecs etleur mille vasseaux / Mer, tu n’ouvriras pas des abîmes nouveaux!—Nothing special!—I shouted. —What? Pardon me? What did that gentle-man say? Nothing special? Why, excusez-moi, mon cher ami, you exaggerate, etc.

It was not just with Mr. d’Hormon that I put on this vapid and contrary air. Iremember once a superintellectualized woman asked me if I shared the views ofSimone de Beauvoir on the problem of the modern woman. I answered that Iinclined more toward the opinion of Kaiser Wilhelm’s ‘‘KKK,’’ that is, ‘‘Kinder,Kirche, Küche.’’ What, what, consternation, I was asked if I was serious, I answered,that yes, but . . .But this sort of game in this place? And in general . . . to play with theartistic-sociological-psychological cream of Paris, served up in a Gothic gravy dishfrom the thirteenth century? And to play . . . at all . . . I, a sick man?—I adore you, you have a gift for making fools of people!—one of therebellious students of Royaumont, Jacques Clauvel, confessed fervently.—Royaumont is good for my nerves—I conﬁded a few days later to Mr.Crespelle, the administrator. —Royaumont is good for your nerves because youruin other people’s nerves—he answered sententiously.Just a little one-upmanship. . . . In any case, I prefer to play than . . .

That I should become an enfant terrible and dissolute fellow—oh, yes, andall the more, the more Royaumont was splendid, majestic, Cartesian, Racinelike,Voltairean—the more it was ethnological, historiographic, logistic, cybernetic—the more it was laden with rosettes, swans, and St. Louis. But I danced in chains,oh, what a crushing oppression, what a hundred-pound weight! The seriousness ofdisease, this complete lack of humor proper to the dark crannies of a sufferingorganism, joined, after all (as if behind my back) with certain unpleasant proper-ties of the place in which I stayed. At two or three in the morning this medievalediﬁce was not one of the most cheerful of places. . . . When the unillustrious stateof my stomach got me out of bed at night, I did not feel particularly conﬁdent in1965665the long corridor, with some sort of reﬂex of light ﬂickering in its depths, while thethickness of the walls pressed forward in the general slumber and the emptinessfarther down responded in the uninhabited rooms, its loneliness, its weight, theubiquitous pressure of an emptiness ﬁlled with dead, ended, past time. In thisexpiring there came from somewhere only the fervent whispering of old Mr.d’Hormon, who, not being able to sleep, recited the poems of Mallarmé, Rim-baud, Racine, in his room, like prayers . . . what would have happened if, walkingdown the corridor I had suddenly come upon some sort of Anomaly, no, not upona ghost, a monster—that would be too naive—but upon Anomaly; why, I had totake into serious consideration that the accumulation of so many lives, stiﬂed by somany deaths, could produce a certain ferment, something that would really sur-prise me, if I came upon this something in a dark corridor. Man is always expectingsomething like this . . . and he is prepared for it. . . . I myself was disease, that is,anomaly, that is, something related to death and more perhaps than a ghost, Ifeared my not being too afraid. . . .

After a year’s immersion in Germany, I looked at the French with curiosity.When, right after arriving from Berlin, I spent a week in a villa not far fromParis, I hobbled as well as I could, using the last bits of my strength, to get to thegate, into the street, to see them again. I wanted to check on how they looked afterthe Germans.The Europeans cast ashore in South America, like melancholy survivors,shells and algae, were weakened . . . here in their nations they are like fruit on atree, juiciest.

I was wondering how much my ﬁrst impression of Paris—when I saw it ayear ago for the ﬁrst time after years in America—how much these impressionscontained in two chapters of my diary devoted to Paris could be hasty, crazy. . . .The Parisians who happened to read this text published in Les Lettres Nouvelleswere fussy. The following letter came from a French writer: ‘‘You hate Paris andyou are entitled to your opinion. But in those chapters one would look in vain for666Volume 3the freshness and honesty of which there is so much on other pages of your diary.Here you use well-worn clichés and are banal, you do not want to get to know thecity, you turn against it with irritation. . . . And one can see more clearly herethan anywhere else how much you concoct reality in order to adjust it to yoursubjective vision.’’Agreed, I did concoct reality, why should this diary be a report or an ofﬁcialrecord . . . my description of the world is made according to the laws of a poem, it issupposed to express my passion, and my passion through the world. What sort ofpassion have I put into my description of Paris?The French from Royaumont—I knew—would also not catch onto this.This elite, which is inclined to believe that in spite of everything ‘‘man has a proudsound!’’ also had to accept that ‘‘youth has a naive sound!’’Elevating oneself above the word soaked with embarrassing nostalgias. . . . Iknow, I recognize . . . how many times have I waved it for the fun of it before theproud nose of maturity! Paris? It wasn’t so much Paris that I was attacking in mynotes as Europe—Paris as the maximal expression of European aesthetics. For oh,Europe, Paris, in you beauty becomes civilized, that is, organized, and what’s moreit is subject to a division of functions: some exist to make beauty, others to consumeit. The beauty of man, humanity, seems to be fragmenting more and more into thewriting of poems and reciting of poems, into the painting of pictures and looking atpictures; into producing lipstick and applying it; into dancing in a ballet andwatching it.This process involves removing the center of beauty from oneself so that itbecomes something external, objective . . . so that it stops hurting . . . and degrad-ing. . . . I in my capacity as a poet want to return to the beauty of the human species,its wild, primal, embarrassing, unrelenting sense . . . its personal sense. . . .Look, there where the child ends and the adult does not yet begin, there,from the fourteenth to twenty-fourth year, man is given his time to blossom. This isthe only time of complete beauty in man. There is in humanity a refuge ofimmortal beauty and grace, but—too bad, too bad!—it is tied to youth. Oh, it is notenough to admire the beauty of abstract pictures—this beauty is not extreme—youhave to live it through what you were, what you are not, through the inferiority ofyouth. . . .This is, more or less, the starting point for my satire on Paris.1965667Lean over the river of passing time, Narcissus, and try to ﬁsh out thereceding, relentlessly charming face. . . .

Conversa-tion! On Saturdays and Sundays we move to the larger Gothic hall for our meals.Amid the ascetic, ecstatic faces carved in wood on the walls, among mitres andcrosses, we, about forty people, at the great tables, hors d’oeuvres, potage, entrée,rôti, salade, fromages, dessert, café. Conversation.Unstinting. Unrelenting. Animated. And the shock of the holy and painedfaces looking at us from the walls? No, because French frivolity is heroic. And the668Volume 3faces stufﬁng themselves at the table, blissfully smiling, gabbing, are not so verydifferent from those on the wall; here, too, the eyes are faded, parchment cheeks,and the side dishes and roasts disappear into gap-toothed mouths, this garrulousassembly has, for the most part, one foot in the grave. Nevertheless, under theguidance of Mr. d’Hormon, deaf as a tree stump, the conversation does not stop foreven an instant. It would seem: they talk in order to drown their identity, with itspain and fear of the walls. . . .These conversations merged into a tiring buzz under the vault, the acous-tics were awful, people answered any old wavy, just to answer, they had deafness ontheir lips and in their eyes, they said any old thing, they said that, but they talked,talked . . . they were eating but the conversation was devouring them. . . .Like talking to a wall.Thought about Anomaly, that nocturnal Anomaly, from my meandering inthe corridor, slowly changed into the idea of a sucking Vampire. . . .

I the obstreperous, I the vampiric, I the amused, I the tormented, I theliving, I the dying.I thought about Europe’s eluding me.

What sort of Columbus am I?It seemed almost silly to me that this enormous thing in history, Europe,instead of dazzling me after years of pampa, years of not seeing it, falls into a pile ofwell-worn generalities.—The worst thing—I thought—is that the truth about it does not interestme in the least. I want to revive it for myself—revive myself with it. All this so thattime would become rejuvenating—instead of aging me and it!

I threw this atthem at breakfast. —How is it—I asked.—This place is full of artwork yet I have notbeen able to catch anyone in contemplation with the exception of excursions ofchildren led around on Sundays and holidays. So it is enough for us to have thesethings hanging on the wall? . . . Of course, it was enough. Pictures, statues, andother wonderful things exist only so that people know they exist . . . one knows theyare and one does not pay any more attention to them than one pays to radiators andventilators.They protested. I demanded that they tell us immediately, from memory,what scene is depicted in the large, eye-catching, and hundred-times-viewed Gobe-lin in the adjoining hall. They did not know. I asked if they could name any otherworks of art found in that room. They could tell me about 40 percent.I asked the librarian, Mr. Gueri, the ideal clerk, in black with a white collarand tie, if he could tell me what percentage of volumes in his seven-thousand-volume library was in circulation, and what percentage rested in eternal peace,670Volume 3requiescat in pace? He looked at me distrustfully and gave me an evasive answer. Iasked him if the government was preparing for the arrival of the inevitable mo-ment when the libraries will be completely full—when they begin to burst thecities, when one will have to give them not just separate buildings but entireneighborhoods, when the accumulation of books and artworks will pour out intothe ﬁelds and forests from cities ﬁlled to the brim?—Let us not forget—I added—that just as quantity turns into quality, soquality also turns into quantity.The son of Valéry, the Iraqi ambassador, a minister from Thailand.The ladies with Robbe-Grillet’s latest novel, La jalousie, in their hands.They pass. Each says: —People apparently can’t get through this book . . . I will! Itold myself that I would!Professor Lucien Goldmann. Broad shouldered, with a warrior’s chest,bearing down, something like a truck or even a thirty-ton ship. He was at theRécamier theater at a production of The Marriage, participated in the discussions,explained to people left and right where the whole secret lay, until he ﬁnally cameout with an article in France Observateur entitled ‘‘Critics Understood Nothing’’ inwhich he gave his own interpretation of the play. It began promisingly. The Mar-riage, in his opinion, is closely bound to the historical cataclysms of our times, it isa ‘‘chronicle of history gone crazy,’’ the action of The Marriage is a grotesqueparody of real events. But then? Goldmann makes the Drunkard into the re-bellious masses, Henry’s ﬁancée into the nation, the King into the government,and me into a ‘‘Polish squire’’ who contained the historical drama in these symbols.I timidly protested, yes, I do not deny that The Marriage is a wild version of a crazyhistory; in the dreamy or drunken becoming of this action is mirrored the fan-tasticality of the historical process, but to make Molly the nation and Father thestate . . . ?? Nothing doing. Goldmann, professor, critic, broad-shouldered Marxist,decreed that I did not know, that he knew better! Rabid Marxist imperialism! Theyuse that doctrine to invade people! Goldmann, armed with Marxism, was thesubject—I, deprived of Marxism, was the object—a few people, not at all amazedthat Goldmann was interpreting me and not the other way around, listened to thediscussion.And the latest bulletins from the front? Yes, from the front because thebattle of my partially acknowledged greatness with these Frenchmen cannot cease1965671for an instant. I could, in fact, or so it would seem, be on a wartime footing withthose who know nothing about me or know it poorly, or I could relax on the sidewith my admirers. But—and I say this seriously—how would I look if the enemycaught me in a moment of such weakness with my worshipers? No, I must con-tinue to be difﬁcult! Difﬁcult! And most of all the way I was in Argentina, oh, oh, ifI would change even an inch under the inﬂuence of Paris, it would be a disaster,no, I must be just the way I was with Flor or Eisler at the Tex, that is how I must benow, oh, oh, in the cupola of Les Invalides, in the towers of the Notre Dame, toleave an impression of myself using Flor from Argentina!With Flor or even old-gentry Poland! That is why I put so much effort intotelling two communists, ‘‘And, reverend sir, in the old days, a boor was a boor and agentleman a gentleman, and that was better.’’ This is what I told them under thechestnut trees. Those two—professors of philosophy, came to attend the Nietzschecongress—were extremely pleased and for a moment all three of us were happy.I feel, however, that politics is encircling me . . . the worst of the wildmonkeys of the Parisian jungle. At dusk I feel the cinctures growing tighter andextending their feelers for me. . . . The ‘‘Polish squire’’ and ‘‘émigré’’ are beginningto hurt, as they are not all that difﬁcult to exchange for ‘‘anti-Semite’’ and even‘‘fascist’’ and a fascist is only a step away from a ‘‘Nazi.’’ The German critic, a Jew,Hans Mayer, who devoted a chapter of his book Ansichten to me, announced fromout of the blue at a meeting of the Formentor jury that he knows for certain that Iam an anti-Semite and that the book I am currently writing is full of anti-Semiticsallies. Who imparted this information to him? This outburst was all the stranger inthat Mayer did, after all, discuss my Diary in his book and he could not have missedthe lengthy passage describing my sympathetic attitude toward Jews (in Warsawcafés I was called the Jewish king). Defend myself? Protest? Oh, oh, let us allow thecoupling of my person with a threadbare vocabulary to give birth to monstrositiesthat will devour one another. It is worse that French newspapers, on the occasionof my arrival in Paris, emphasized my countlike appearance and aristocratic man-nerisms, and the Italian press wrote gentiluomo polacco. Protest? oh, oh, whatwould I accomplish with protests? Yes, I know that this compromises me in the eyesof the avant-garde, students, and the left, as if I were the author of Quo Vadis; whileit is the left and not the right that is the natural territory of my expansion. Unfortu-nately, the old story from times when the right saw me as a ‘‘Bolshevik’’ and the left672Volume 3as an unbearable anachronism is repeating itself. But I do see something of myhistorical role in this: oh, oh, oh, to enter Paris with innocent nonchalance, as aconservative seditionist, provincial avant-gardist, rightist leftist, leftist rightist, Ar-gentine Sarmatian, aristocratic plebeian, antiartistic artist, immature adult, disci-plined anarchist, and a person who is artiﬁcially candid and candidly artiﬁcial.This will do us, you and me . . . a lot of good!Illness.Stone.Night and vampire.With the Charaires under the chestnut tree.Death.A philosophical discussion with Mr. d’Hormon at the table. Probably themost splendid of all my disputes! I said, ‘‘There is a concealed Bergson in yourRenan,’’ to which the old man, not having heard a single word, answered, ‘‘For themonad must be conceived of in this perspective, believe me, I have thought thisthrough and Democritus, after all . . .’’ I (brutally): —No, I do not trust Theocritus!He (charmingly, with the greatest courtesy): —What? Heraclitus? Well yes, yes, Isupport your feelings to an extent, cher Monsieur, but Heraclitean horizons . . .People were listening in deep silence with the greatest reverence, the whole tablehung on our every word, until ﬁnally the old man patted my shoulder: Noussommes du même étage (we are on the same level).Hector, Jean, Raoul, Dominique. Fourteen, ﬁfteen, sixteen years old. Theychange plates, carry the platters around, brisk, ﬂuid—is this ballet to serve us or arewe overeating and displaying our dignity just so they can dance? In the eveningthey rush out of the kitchen into the park, playgrounds and tennis court, jump onmotorcycles, and then St. Louis, the tower, Gothic facades, congresses confer-ences, artists, scholars, all this collapses before these children, as before an invaderspeaking a foreign tongue.6731966

In the sixty-ﬁrst year of my life I have attained what a man usually acquiresaround thirty: a family life, apartment, dog, cat, comforts. . . . And I have undoubt-edly also become (everything testiﬁes to this) a ‘‘writer.’’ This silly story, lagging674Volume 3along strangely and sluggishly from early youth through my entire life has some-how taken on color; lo and behold, I am a ‘‘writer.’’Except that the shore I left two years ago, there on the other side of Gibral-tar, the Canary Islands, the ocean beneath the hills of the Brazilian coast and thebeaches of Uruguay, is still roaring and smoking in me. From here Argentinaseems to be heaving ocean foam and wind. I have her in me like something dark,imprecise, puzzling. I will probably never be able to get used to Argentina, I keepwavering, now it seems to me that she was destined for me, she was in my stars,then again comes the thought that no, this was something accidental, external, likean animal’s leap into a forest, predatory.It is also painful to me that so little will remain of that Argentine period.Where are the people who could tell my story, describe and pass on what I was like?The people I spent time with were not usually writers; it is difﬁcult to demand color-ful anecdotes, happy characterizations, a lovely silhoutette . . . and, I must admit thatI was different with each one, thus none of them know what sort of person I was.I get an unpleasant feeling when the mail sometimes brings me news ofwhat is being written about me in Argentina. As one could have expected, I amcharacterized as a kind-hearted uncle, friend of young people; in these cozy littlememoirs, articles, I am the conventional ﬁgure of an artist ‘‘misunderstood’’ andrejected by my milieu. Oh well! Tu l’a voulu, Georges Dandin! Why did you choosea way of living that was difﬁcult to describe—a too-complicated system of masks?Wary people care that their lives are suited for memoirs. At any rate, it is certain thatthere, beyond the ocean, even my memory is undergoing disintegration, is dying.Will I be able to revive once again, here, on the Riviera? For now I am likethe tone of a piano key that has been pressed, there is more death in me than life. It istoo late.

Sometime in May Cosmos appeared, just in Polish for the time being,published by Kultura.I gladly call this work a ‘‘novel about a reality that is creating itself.’’ Andbecause a detective novel is precisely this—an attempt at organizing chaos— Cos- mos has a little of the form of a detective romance.I am establishing two starting points, two anomalies, very distant from one1966675another: (a) a hanged sparrow, (b) the association of Katasia’s lips with Lena’s.These two puzzles will begin to demand sense. One will permeate the other instriving to create a whole. A process of conjectures, associations, circumstantial evi-dence, something will begin to create itself but it is a rather monstrous embryo . . .and this murky, incomprehensible charade will call for its solution . . . it will searchfor an explanatory, ordering idea. . . .What adventures, and what rows with reality during this tearing out of thefog!Internal and external logic.The stratagems of logic.Intellectual wilderness: analogues, oppositions, symmetries. . . .Suddenly the growing dithyrambic rhythm of the furiously forming Real-ity. And its disintegration. Catastrophe. Shame.The sudden overﬂowing with excessive fact.The creation of backwater tributaries . . . dark caves . . . obstructions . . .impediments, whirlpools . . . twists. . . .Etc., etc., etc.The idea circles me like a wild beast. . . .Etc.My cooperation. I on that side, the side of the charade. I as he who tries toﬁgure out the charade through himself. I abducted by the whirlwind of events,seeking Form.In vain do I throw myself into the whirlwind, at the cost of my happi-ness. . . .Microcosm—macrocosm.Mythologizing. Distance. Echo.The sudden breaking out of logical absurdity. Shamelessness.Reference points. Leon and his mass.Etc. etc.

Still in connection with Cosmos: from the immensity of phenomena tak-ing place around me, I draw one thing. I notice, for example, the ashtray on mytable (the rest of the objects on the table slip into nonbeing).676Volume 3If I can justify why I noticed the ashtray in particular (‘‘I want to drop mycigarette ash’’), everything is all right.If I noticed the ashtray accidentally, without any intention, and I neverreturn to this observation, everything is still as it should be.If, however, having noticed this phenomenon without signiﬁcance, youreturn to it for a second time . . . woe! Why did you notice it again if it is withoutsigniﬁcance? Ah, so it means something to you after all, if you returned. . . . Oh yes,by dint of the fact that you concentrated unjustiﬁably on this phenomenon onesecond longer, this thing already begins to stand out, becomes remarkable. . . . No,no (you deny), this is an ordinary ashtray! —Ordinary? Why are you denying it if itis ordinary?This is how a phenomenon becomes an obsession.Is reality obsessive by its very essence? In light of our building our worldsthrough associating phenomena, I would not be surprised if at the primal begin-ning of all time, there was a double association. It indicates direction in chaos andis the beginning of order.In consciousness there is something like its being its own trap.

Also at this time, at the end of April and the beginning of May, I had sodreadfully stupid an experience that I was sick with humiliation for two weeks.Let us not forget that a poet is an intimate, nocturnal, almost undergroundbeing. The artist has the nature of a bat, rat, mole, and mimosa. I was sure that thisyear I had no chance of making off with the ten thousand dollar InternationalPublishers Award. The press did not name me in the list of candidates and peopleexplained to me that such and such considerations, interests, tactics, and pro-cedures put me in the margin. I did not pay much attention to the deliberations ofthe jury, right next door, in nearby Valescure. But during the third or fourth day ofdeliberations, an Italian journalist from Valescure visited me to conduct an inter-view and said that there was more and more talk about me, that Pornograﬁa wasbeginning to stand out from the dozens of works discussed. This was enough. I wasovercome by desire. Dollars! And then somebody kept calling, dollars, dollars, inthe ﬁnal round it was between me and Saul Bellow, dollars! On the day the1966677announcement was supposed to be made, my dignity was a rag, my sovereigntyidiocy, dollars, dollars, dollars. . . .Which with the passing of minutes, were vanishing . . . at ﬁve in theafternoon I was drinking coffee in a small café on the square, dollars, when theydrove up: Bondy and his wife, the Greek writer Kay Cicellis, Seaver, the director ofGrove Press, and a few more people, all from Valescure. A report on the dramaticdeliberations which, if not for . . . Bah! If the Spanish delegation, which was withme in principle, had not put forth a certain Latin American writer in the ﬁrstround of voting, to give him a little publicity . . . Bah! If Pornograﬁa had not beencalled Pornograﬁa . . . because luck would have it that the same jury granted itsyoung writers award to an American a few days earlier for a novel that was a littleextreme, so they were worried about the title, something about too much of a goodthing . . . Bah! If not for the tactics of the German delegation and the particularinterests of large publishing houses . . . Bah! If . . .Relato refero. I started a little rumor that, well, actually, I could get a lawyerand take this jury to court. Yes indeed! The legal bases for such court action areundoubtedly there. The granting of this award, the largest after the Nobel, is nolaughing matter. The members of the jury are obligated by the statutes to grant theaward to the best book artistically. Only this consideration should determine thewinner. In the meantime, as one can see from the press reports, they considerfactors that have nothing to do with artistic quality: give it to this one because ‘‘wemust award someone from the nouveau roman français,’’ or give it to that onebecause ‘‘it is time for Latin America’’ . . . the members of the jury drink a littlewhiskey and chat about all sorts of topics. It would be interesting, I said, to win thistrial. This would bring about an avalanche of other trials, all the injured woulddemand a revision of all the awards and this would lead to liquidating the Award assuch . . . this gratuity, this compromise. . . .I was dissuaded, ha, ha, what paradoxes, then Seaver took me aside, laid outcertain propositions in the name of Grove Press, dollars, dollars, I felt a little better,but in the days that followed something else leaked out (because in the papers a lotwas written about how I lost by one vote), so it was as if I felt a little better. But Ireally felt just awful.Please understand me: we artists know the ephemeral, ﬂeeting nature of678Volume 3our undertaking extremely well. Of course, covering paper with made-up stories isnot a serious occupation. How ashamed I was of this in the ﬁrst years that I wrote,how red-faced I would get if someone caught me at it! An engineer, doctor, ofﬁcer,pilot, or worker is taken seriously right away, but an artist attains serious recogni-tion only after many long years.An artist steps up to each person individually, whispers in his ear, andquietly demands that he recognize him. It has happened! I have one, even two, whohave recognized me. I now have ﬁfteen, one hundred, four thousand of them. Ibegin to breathe deeply—so I am approaching seriousness at last! How many yearsit takes! My climb swallowed up thirty years of effort, poverty, and humilation.What then? Then they grab you by the collar and bam! . . . they stick youbefore the High Tribunal. O blessed night, where art thou?! A minute ago you werecompletely alone . . . now in a social atmosphere, in the light of hotel lamps, youare one of thirty milch cows and one of thirty racing mares that are patted andjudged. Who is that cultured old schoolmarm that blurted out that she was ‘‘inca-pable’’ of reading more than ﬁfty pages of your novel? This is, in person, thechairman of the honorable jury herself, Mrs. McCarthy. McCarthy? For me,McCarthy—and I say this with absolute candor—does not belong to serious litera-ture. I am ready to swear under oath that, for me, McCarthy was always a medi-ocre, third-, even fourth-class writer. How is it then that I, at the height of myefforts, after so long and so hard a journey, ﬁnd myself at the feet of this respectablelady prattling she was ‘‘incapable,’’ etc. What sort of jokes are these? Jokes with myseriousness? With my pride? With my dignity?! What sort of demon has suddenlyreturned me to that stupidity, frivolity, and triviality of my beginnings?!Who? What demon? Ten thousand dollars! That you desire! That havepenetrated you to the core! Ten thousand? But this is a completely ridiculous sum!A million at least! Fifty million!No, ten thousand, a sum made by an average ﬁnancier on a completelymediocre transaction.(Written not to disparage awards, but to be able to be a candidate for them asstingily as possible, without damaging my inner life. But I wrote this also for thepublic good; it is time people understood how hurtful this rabble can be. . . .)
BBB1966679I will also mention something that happened not long ago, in Novemberprobably, having to do with Sandauer’s essay. . . . But ﬁrst a few words about a walkin the valley of the Var. A walk in the Var River valley? It is being done, we arealready hastening along the balcony of the Alpes Maritimes, open to the sea. Thevalley, the dry bed of the wide river, so what? Farther? Yes, the highway takes usdeep inside, into the ascending mountains . . . what’s this? There, a thousandmeters above us, a little bourgade with a castle, with a tower, it hangs off the nose ofan enormous rock . . . onward! Winding roads, precipice, droning engine. Break-fast time? Not a prayer. In this tiny medieval place everything is closed, boardedup. End of the season. Autumn. We drive down. But we spotted the road divid-ing . . . this one to the right, to Roquesteron! And the trip to Roquesteron begins inthe whiteness of bursting sun, through an autumn spattered with color . . . thetransparency of leaves, gold and red, the depths of shade, enormous verdure,rushing water, and nests of rock.At ﬁve in the afternoon back in Vence. I can deﬁnitely not reconcile myselfto their literature. Wouldn’t it be better for them not to have a literature at all?On the table in front of me is Sandauer’s essay from the Warsaw Kulturaentitled ‘‘Gombrowicz, Man and Writer.’’ For the last seven years I have heardnothing from over there but silence (and sometimes mudslinging), what does thismean, are they being allowed to write about me again?Gréolière, Thorenc, Coursegoules, I am full of panoramas.Polish literature in Poland is ostensibly the same as all the literatures in theWest: they have ‘‘excellent writers,’’ ‘‘ﬁne works,’’ poetry, prose, criticism, feuille-tons, awards, contests, conferences. There you have it! Just like Paris! It is onlyupon closer inspection that one discovers that everything is inﬂated. And who canknow whether they are heroic for blowing on the embers of Polish literature inconditions so . . . difﬁcult . . . or whether they are practical, grabbing thosesinecures, honors, comforts whenever they can? . . . Tragic? Or sly?This ‘‘humanism’’ . . . this virtuous cannon of theirs, shooting bullets ofmoral condemnation at ‘‘violence perpetrated upon man.’’ But why does thiscannon ﬁre in just one direction? What sort of one-way morality is this?Sandauer? We are old acquaintances. A scrappy clerc, he struck at thatﬁction the hardest . . . but in the confusion of concept, people, values, how am Isupposed to know whether that Sandauer is still today’s Sandauer? On paper a680Volume 3person is even more elusive than in life. Literature is a row of sentences, waddlinglike geese, one behind the other. A person can write three honest, free, proudsentences but in the fourth sentence this honesty of his concentrates itself on, forexample, my ‘‘feudal complexes’’ instead of choosing some other aspect of myperson—and this is already a slight distortion—and although the next sentenceswill again be so ﬁrm and ruthless that we say to ourselves with admiration, ‘‘Well,how about this!’’ not too much farther down, one of them will mention my ‘‘fascistinclinations.’’ . . . We will then notice that honesty has not stopped being honesty,nor ﬁrmness ﬁrmness, no, they have merely begun to choose the areas of theiractivity with a certain caution. . . .This, for example, is a Sandauer passage having to do with Mrs. Swinarskaand our famous meeting.This interview, Sandauer writes, may not be so far from the truth becausethe ‘‘overbearing, contrary, provocative [tone] has something Gombrowiczian init.’’ And, he adds, Gombrowicz himself often mentions his fascist inclinations (thisis followed by quotations from my diary).How much freedom and expertise in these subtle analyses—too subtleperhaps in reference to blatant swinishness. To hell with nuances or whether thetone was Gombrowiczian or not because, as Sandauer knows very well, this wholeaffair was nothing more than a crude political campaign against me: for twomonths those unfortunate Polish newspapers worked me over on orders and con-demned me in the strongest possible terms, while my correction, sent not just tothe newspapers but to the Writers Union, was shelved on orders. All of the local‘‘leading’’ and ‘‘excellent’’ writers, all subtle, moral, responsible and European,watched this working over of a silenced victim without daring to utter a word. Idon’t hold this against Sandauer, of course. That he sat like a mouse under abroom and didn’t let out a squeak—who knows, maybe he wasn’t informed wellenough at the time. But now he is informed because as he himself admits, he readmy detailed explanations in the Parisian Kultura. So what? So instead of at leastkeeping silent out of shame, our Mr. Critic writes, wrinkling his nose, that it reallyis strange how this Gombrowicz has a knack for creating scandals . . . and hecommences an analysis of my spiritual tonations.Et tu, Brute? ‘‘For Brutus is an honorable man.’’ But perhaps we should not1966681expect too much. If the criticism of this critic cannot function as he would like, letit at least function as it can. Let us give him a reduced fare. . . .*

Sandauer’s reﬂections in this essay in regard to my purported sexual devia-tions? By all means! As long as this is done with tact and solemnity. . . . I know verywell that the right to pride is paid for with humility and I am not avoiding analysesthat I myself provoke with my half-hearted conﬁdences. (And why are the conﬁ-dences half-hearted? Because one is and is not a homosexual; because one is at acertain period in one’s life or in certain circumstances; that—this is my opinion—there is practically no man who could swear under oath that he never had thetemptation. It is difﬁcult to demand too-categorical a confession on the subject).But I fear that Sandauer does not lend himself to this kind of confession.Five years ago I wrote the following in my diary:
After all, he saw more and more clearly that his understanding with Sandauerwas far from perfect, encompassing only part of his works and his person. Onecould not expect Sandauer to have the extraordinary receptiveness and sensitiv-ity that allow Jele ´ nski to grasp things in midﬂight—Sandauer was a species ofbeetle, an individual marching to his own drummer, a mastodon, crustacean,monk, hippopotamus, crank, inquisitor, cactus, martyr, crocodile, sociologist. . . .†
What, I ask, can this cactus know about Eros, deviant or not? For him theerotic world will always be a separate room locked up with a key, unjoined to theother rooms of the human house. Sociology, yes, psychology . . . these are therooms in which he feels at home. But eroticism is, to him, ‘‘monomania.’’Novels, those volatile fairy tales, become signiﬁcant only when the worldunveiled by them becomes something real to us. Dostoevsky will remain a fairytale for someone who does not grasp him in his naked reality. Kafka, Valéry, Dante,surrealism, dadaism, anything at all in art, everything in art, has the right to existonly insofar as it pertains to reality, to some new, sometimes shocking, realitywhich it makes accessible, alive, palpable.
*A reference to Sandauer’s book No Reduced Fare.†Diary, vol. 2, p. 453.682Volume 3Sandauer, researching my erotic deviations. But he would ﬁrst have todetermine if they led to some sort of truth. If not, then they are not worth his oranyone else’s time. This sort of case study would lend itself only to a hospital. Acritic who would want to assess Pornograﬁa, for example, would ﬁrst have toexamine whether such a view of man would result in a genuine enrichment ofknowledge about ourselves. The author of this book says that here man’s desire tobe God is pitted against another desire, extremely different: to be Young. Is thisreal? Unreal? Enriching? Realized in the novel? What is the extent of this? What isits dynamic?Am I wrong if in my work a man ascending, that is, a young man, mustbecome an idol (or perhaps: the completion of a man already realized, aging,descending)? Is it merely a symptom of my pathology when I claim that the proudruling of the older over the younger, together with all of its social, cultural, andpsychological consequences, serves to blur the other, equally important, reality—namely, that the man descending can bind himself to life only through a beingascending, maturing—for life is always ‘‘ascending’’? Am I a pervert when I claimthat the nature of a boy, so speciﬁc, so different in its incompleteness, inadequacy,inferiority, in its strange lightness, becomes essential to understanding the natureof an adult—and, thereby, the nature of our adult world? Am I sick when I claimthat in humanity there is a constant secret cooperation between ages and stages ofdevelopment, that there is a play of mutual captivation, enchantments, violence,thanks to which the ‘‘adult’’ never is merely an ‘‘adult’’? We say: man. The wordmeans nothing to me. I would ask: A man of what age? Enchanted by what age? Aman devoted to what age? Bound to what age in his humanity?These are questions that, even if they are not named in Pornograﬁa, deter-mine the nature of the experiment that happens in it, and especially the category ofbeauty and poetry that it is about. But what has this beetle understood of all this?Actually, about as much as Madame McCarthy. For him the action of this novelhas nothing, and I mean nothing, in common with reality, he thinks it is a littlefable, that everything in it happens, oh, of its own accord, magically, simply atFrederick’s command, a supernatural and practically ‘‘divine’’ character . . . who,nota bene, is my alter ego. From which the penetrating Sandauer concludes that asa result of publishing successes on the international market I have been stricken by1966683megalomania. . . . Oyoyoy! I agree that nonerotic natures have a hard time fathom-ing erotic worlds and I really do not at all expect my works to be assimilated toosmoothly. I would feel rather uneasy if it happened without resistance; but theremust be some sort of limit to stupidity even for Messrs. Critics. And what can a manwho interprets my books so shallowly and unwisely know about me? Why shouldhe assiduously establish all sorts of aspects of the antinomy ‘‘superiority-inferiority’’playing in me if he is incapable of tying it to something really essential? And why ishe digging around in my ‘‘deviations’’ if he is incapable of ﬁguring out theirramiﬁcations?

My mother’s maiden name was Kotkowska. It is not certain, unfortunately,yes, it is rather uncertain, the Kotkowskis’ descending from the mythical ´Scibór. But be that as it may, Bodzechów, the family residence (where I spent part of mychildhood) measured over ﬁve thousand hectares of prime Sandomierz land. Thevenerable manor was built by the Ma™achowskis in a century-old park, where theghost of Chancellor Ma™achowski strolled on nights tremulous with a full moon.My grandmother, Onufrowa Gombrowicz, was of (the better) D˛ abrowskis, born of Benis™awska (good), who was born of Baroness Toplicka (good), who wasborn of So™tanówna, daughter of the chamberlain So™tan and Radziwi™™owna (ex-cellent).

*A novel by Józef Weyssenhoff describing the amorous adventures of a young hunter.1966685Remembering Julian Tuwim, a book published in Poland, contains aboutforty accounts by various people, but all of it looks as if it came from the pen of oneperson who is not, just between you and me, too intelligent. . . . (O literature! Demortuis nihil nisi . . . bad news. . . . We have to get rid of this mawkishness, nogenius can handle it!)This fat volume does not bring much honor to the Poet. It is obvious that thePoet specialized in playing the role of the Poet from early youth (therefore he wasnoble, alert, intense, magical, eaglelike, fervent, human, honest, simple . . .) and hedelivered this Poet tirelessly from morning to night. And, who knows, maybe therole ﬁnally entered his bloodstream. Me, I recall that in the prewar Café Zie-mia ´nska, he wore us out a bit with his not allowing us to forget, even for ﬁve minutes,that he was a Poet. I am a proponent of greater discretion in these delicate matters.This cloying book smells of the worst traditions, or rather conventions. . . .Tuwim himself does not add much; as one can see from the text, in these night-ingale tralalas he almost never hit upon a word worth noting (except for hissometimes very amusing jokes). Ladies and gentlemen, that the world aroundTuwim broke down so easily into the Poet and the worshipers of the Poet will notbe to your credit. Why did you allow this to happen? Where did all this indulgencecome from? Is there not a drop of salutory coolness, severity, irony, criticism, orcommon sense in you? Nothing. Only an eagerness to participate fully in themelodramatic scenery of this tralalaling bel canto?The end of Tuwim was his last years in People’s Poland—how deserved!His nightingaleness had to end badly, had to lead him to being an ofﬁcial Poet, aprovider of Beauty, a functionary of nobility, a Citizen-Bard, etc. It was no accidentthat his tralalaling led him to the palacelike villa in Anin (palacelike; not the ﬁrstnor the last of the Noble-minded, lovingly bent over the misery of the prole-tariat . . .). Between his immoral naïveté (because naïveté is immoral) and theincurable naïveté of proletarian culture there always existed a profound under-standing. An excess of poetry is so painful in its consequences!What do I have against him, after all? He allowed them to adore him, that ishis sin!

I am lazy, so instead of overworking myself, I will attach the ‘‘interview withmyself’’ below. I wrote this at the request of the German daily Die Welt in Hamburg.Not too long ago they were barking at me in the People’s Repub about myserving the Germans ‘‘for Ford dollars.’’ And now the Germans have come downon me. A person who would see a contradiction in this would be completelydeprived of a sense of higher historical logic, expressing itself in the fact that whenthe Poles go bam, bam, bam (they strike), then the Germans also go bam, bam,bam (they strike).

Interview with myself for Die Welt:Question: What have you got to say for yourself?Answer: Nothing special.Ques.: What . . . for example?1966687Ans.: Heck if I know.Ques.: ?Ans.: Okay! Now we can begin. That beginning was just to be careful. Sothat people would not expect something too brilliant from me. I take it that on thisstage here in Die Welt, where a writer is listening to his own confessions, many ofmy colleagues have already shone . . . as for me, I prefer not to shine next tosomeone else’s light. I prefer to shine where it is dark. So let us conduct an ordinarylittle interview, without ﬁreworks and arabesques, without pretensions.Ques.: Three of your books have appeared in Germany in recent months.Let us talk ﬁrst about Berliner Notizen. Let us remind our readers of the circum-stances surrounding this matter. The Ford Foundation invites you to Berlin for ayear’s stay. You publish your impressions ﬁrst in Kultura, then in a book entitledBerliner Notizen. The book evokes very contradictory reactions in the Germanpress, some of which are even quite hostile. It is enough to review the titles ofthe articles: in Die Zeit, ‘‘Ein Exot in der deutschen Wohnküche’’; in MünchenMerkur, ‘‘Klecks in Berliner Gästenbuch’’; in Der Spiegel, ‘‘Dieses Glitzerding.’’What do you have to say for yourself?Ans.: Yes, some Germans felt hurt. But I wrote those things to hurt Germans.Ques.: To hurt them?Ans.: Yes, a writer ought to be painful. Just as in love: one has to get throughthe clothes to the living ﬂesh.Ques.: But how do you explain the fact that your touch became a caress tosome Germans and a pinch to others?Ans.: This is a very basic difﬁculty—impossible to avoid. Because I amsomeone; because I am someone very hungry for form, the most distinct form . . . Iam also very aggressive . . . and I have enemies who hate me, no, this is too strong,who cannot stand me, whom I irritate . . . because my very existence underminestheirs. This is a spiritual struggle for being, as old as the world. Mrs. Maria Oster-kamp wrote that I am an extreme person, the result of which is that my diary has tobe either accepted or dismissed as a whole. Fine. I am not a proponent of luke-warm soups.Ques.: But you were a guest in Berlin. Doesn’t this obligate you insome way?Ans.: No, a self-respecting literature must demand, more than anything688Volume 3else, that it be taken seriously. In Berlin I was not a guest but something far morehorrifying, desperate, powerful, I was myself, my own existence and my owndrama. Guest! Drama! Existence! Grappling with fate! Today, in a day of easyvoyages, a writer becomes more of a cultural traveling salesman. No. No one isgoing to import me as if I were a bag of lozenges. I truly beg your pardon, I am aSpirit. A Spirit, of course, that is as well brought up as possible (I have the impres-sion that nothing in this regard can be held against the Berliner Notizen), but aspirit nevertheless.Ques.: Hm . . . one has to admit that your opponents see the matter in a lessemotional and more practical light. You were distinctly given to understand thatfor the round sum in dollars received from the Ford Foundation you could havebeen somewhat . . . more amenable in your writing. . . .Ans.: Hélas! This argument was also advanced. I am afraid that this wasneither very fair nor very elegant on the part of my opponents. The Foundationplaces no conditions on invited artists: come, sit in Berlin awhile, do what you like,no one expects anything of you. If, therefore, I wrote the Berlin diary, it was notbecause I was invited but because I write it wherever I happen to be . . . in BuenosAires, Paris, Berlin. . . . But I am being awkward in defending myself too extensivelyagainst these accusations. It might seem that Berliner Notizen provoked a scandal,while I actually received more responses that were warmly well-wishing and genu-inely friendly.Ques.: Probably no one expressed the kindheartedness of some Germansbetter than Karl Korn in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. This is the conclusionof his article: ‘‘Gombrowicz got the most from his role as a guest. He extracted thehighest art, to really be himself. . . . Today one is silent about Germans. This Pole hasbroken that silence. He made it known that—like it or not—we are his business. Andhe has become our business, whether we like it or not.’’ What do you say to this?Ans.: Korn expresses a very real need the German soul has. Here a Germanis asking a foreigner to be free, asking him for honesty, and especially indepen-dence, because he knows that without this he himself cannot be free, honest,independent toward the foreigner. Toward the foreigner, that is, toward the world.Toward the world, that is, toward himself.Ques.: So what are your critics demanding?Ans.: They would prefer more . . . respect. . . . Let me be allowed to express1966689my humble opinion: this contradiction in the German soul will get deeper inproportion to the increase in . . . comfort. Material comfort but spiritual comforteven more. Actually they go hand in hand.Ques.: Let us move on to the next book that recently appeared, Aus dem Tagebuch des Witold Gombrowicz, the popular edition of your diary for the years1953–56.Ans.: If I were to give my cocreators, that is, my readers (because reading isno less creative than writing) some really important advice, it would be this: do notsimplify your task by saying ‘‘he is doing this to be paradoxical’’ or ‘‘to go against thegrain’’ or ‘‘to irritate.’’ Paradoxes, poking fun, épater-ing . . . no, this is not for us, it’scoming out of our ears, it was ﬁne when one could shock the innocence of therespectable bourgeoisie. Try to believe me and you will see how all my oddities andgames begin to join in an organic whole capable of living. In me, artiﬁciality iswhat enables me to be honest, jokes lead to seriousness, obstreperousness to truth.Try to grasp me as profoundly as possible. Honest, I am up to it!Ques.: And what would you say about Indizien (Cosmos), your last novel?It’s already in the bookstores.Ans.: I don’t like these births. . . . They’re unpleasant. . . .Ques.: You mean you’re not sure of that work?Ans.: I really don’t know. It is really still hot, it just appeared in Polish andGerman, and it will appear in France any day now. Not that I am afraid. . . . I do notlike . . . All my labors are difﬁcult, complicated. . . . First something like darkness,saturated with light consternation, appears around every one of my books. Myfriends are disturbed, often ashamed. I try to know as little about this as possible,and it is only months later that I begin to look through the clippings sent to mefrom newspapers. I have yet to see one of my plays at the theater. I prefer not tothink about this to the extent that I almost always overlook the premiere dates andit is only an unexpected telegram that brings me back to reality.Ques.: What last thing do you have to say?Ans.: Friends! Allow me, by way of an exception, to occupy myself withsomething other than myself: Europe. The name ‘‘Europe,’’ so much broader than‘‘Germany,’’ ‘‘Poland,’’ or ‘‘France,’’ excites me, so full is it of a nascent energy. Butthe rapid advance of European technologists is not accompanied at all by the rapidadvance of European humanists . . . could it be that the spirit of Europe has sunk690Volume 3into a machine? What has happened that we humanists are bungling everything—music is becoming pettier, poetry drier, literature terribly boring? Yes, indeed, forthe last two hundred years the European consciousness has been under the sign ofreduction: in Germany Kant, Marx, or Husserl, or Heidegger are the gradual stagesof a careful curtailing of the spirit. But the devaluation of art and literature hasnothing to do with this process, whose gravity cannot be underestimated. What afailure! Absurdity is present in everything we touch, in our way of creating (whichbecame cerebral and repugnant), in our talking about art (there is too much talk),in all the mechanisms of our little artistic world, that gigantic machinery made upof 100,000 doctors, docents, interpreters, glossators, sucking pale blood from theanemic bodies of thousands of ordinary artists. What is happening? Where havethe splendid, red-blooded, stunning beef steaks such as Goethe, Beethoven, evapo-rated to from our artistic kitchen? How can we make art stop being an expression ofour mediocrity and again become an expression of our greatness, beauty, andpoetry? This is my program: Primo, to realize, in the most painful way, whatmilksops we are. Secundo, to discard all aesthetic theories produced during the lastﬁfty years that are working furtively to weaken the personality. This whole period ispoisoned by striving for the leveling of values and people—away with it! Tertio,having done away with the theories, to turn to people, to the great personalities ofthe past, and in covenant with them to recover in our own persons the eternalwellsprings of imagination, inspiration, panache, and grace. For there is no de-mocracy in which some kind of aristocracy, some species of superiority, would notbe attainable. Dixi. I am taking advantage of this opportunity to warmly greet MissHanna Garthe of Sarrebrück.

Revenge is the delight of the gods!The dumbbell who gave himself up to this intoxicating delight (I knowwho he is) forgot that in the natural course of things I would also get my chance.But I am including in my diary my little letter (below) to Wiadomo´ sci inLondon, not out of revenge but out of a citizen’s concern, to draw the attention of1966691émigré opinion to the gaps and ﬂaws in our émigré press. How many émigrédailies, weeklies, monthlies, devoted to nothing but Polish life do we have? Andhow many Poles in emigration found out from the Polish press that a certain, forexample, Ivona, had considerable success here and there? Not to mention otherlittle facts of the same authorship, equally worthy of attention, and busily clad inthe veil of silence. It might seem, in truth, that our press divides authors into likableand despicable. They write even the tiniest detail down for the likable ones andthey avoid writing down even less tiny details for the despicable ones.

To the editor of Wiadomo´ sci:The Polish critic Artur Sandauer visited me and said that various people inliterary circles in Poland, including himself, received clippings from Wiadomo´ sciand Dziennik Polski sent anonymously from London from which one could sur-mise that my play Ivona, performed in Paris a few months ago, had been ‘‘panned’’by the critics.Intrigued by this strange news, I looked into the issues of Wiadomo´ sci fromthis period. Sure enough, in the 7 October issue of last year, there is a note entitled‘‘Gombrowicz ﬂogged in Paris.’’The beginning said that Ivona was ‘‘mercilessly panned’’ by the Figaroreviewer, Jean-Jacques Gautier. After which there follow long excerpts from hisreview. I will allow myself to refresh your memory: ‘‘One cannot imagine a morepretentious or depressing spectacle. It is difﬁcult not to shake with outrage at suchan indulgence of absurdity, incompetence, stupidity, and bluff.’’ Et cetera. In theend there were an encouraging two little sentences from the author of the piecestating that another critic, however, Lemarchand, ‘‘has great esteem for the play aswell as the set.’’ I want to share with the readers of Wiadomo´ sci the rather outdated, but nonetheless felicitous, news to the Polish ear that the play of the Polish authorwas received quite well in Paris. In the Information Bulletin of the de BourgogneTheater (this is the troupe that did Ivona), the following is listed under the title‘‘Ivona in Paris.’’692Volume 3‘‘Out of thirty-nine reviews, thirty were favorable (of these, twenty were veryﬂattering); ﬁve favorable for the play as well as the set design, and four unfavorable(of which one was extremely unfavorable).’’The ‘‘extremely unfavorable’’ one was, of course, the one reprinted inWiadomo´ sci. But let us listen to how some of the favorable ones sound: Jean Pagetin Combat: ‘‘This is a very great play’’; Robert Abirached in Le Nouvel Observateur:‘‘A masterpiece’’; Gilles Sandier in Arts: ‘‘An admirable, astonishing presentation’’;Christian Megret in Carrefour: ‘‘This lesson in good and beautiful theater.’’ . . .‘‘Gombrowicz panned in Paris’’ right? As for the review in Le Figaro, let uslisten to the response it got in the French press.‘‘Poor Gombrowicz,’’ writes Sandier in Arts, ‘‘let the rabble [goujats] accuseyou of being a half-breed. . . . French theater is proud that it can present you, theauthor of Ferdydurke and one of the people who bring honor to our time.’’ Therewere protests against the brutal review in Le Figaro, not just in Arts, but in otherpublications and on the radio.I will not blame Wiadomo´ sci for overlooking the stark fact that the Polishplay in Paris was unquestionably a great success. One cannot demand satisfactorypress service from a publication functioning in difﬁcult, émigré conditions. Butyou will admit, Mr. Editor, that you owe the readers of the magazine as well as methe satisfaction of printing the above correction. Polish opinion has the right toknow that a Polish writer has not made a clown of himself at the Théâtre de Franceand that I, a writer, would have the right to turn to you with the cautious requestfor, I would say, a more friendly disposition, in connection with greater, I wouldsay, care in presenting information that concerns me. For the dose of silence,distortion, and calumny to which the red regime in Poland sentences me is quiteenough, I feel, and I would prefer that the émigré press not add oil to the ﬂameswith such tasty morsels.A writer, gagged in his own country, should be able to count on the sup-port, help, and goodwill of the Polish press. How eloquent all this is when takentogether! You, sir, exhaust and torment yourself to give this Cinderella nativeliterature a little success in the world, and for this they will strangle you in Poland,pinch you in emigration, and some dirty and envious joker will disseminate thisstuff by mail, to boot! Ugh!And one more little thing. After the premiere in the Théâtre de France1966693there followed a premiere in the Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm. DagensNyheter: ‘‘An extraordinary theatrical event’’; Stockholm Tidningen: ‘‘A produc-tion exceeding all our known boundaries’’; Aftonbladet: ‘‘This is not theater, thisis magic.’’‘‘The premier of Ivona,’’ writes the Stockholm Wiadomo´ sci Polskie, ‘‘trans- formed itself into a paean of Polish dramatic creativity.’’Hm . . .

It’s all ready to go to print. I looked it over. Corrected it here and there. Ican now send it to Giedroyc so that the third volume of my diary, from the years1961–66, can appear.I am far from being satisﬁed with it.I will say honestly: one of the most important tasks that constantly rattledaround inside me when I began working on my diary in those years has not beenaccomplished. I see this now clearly . . . it depresses me. . . .I have been unable to express adequately my passage from inferiority tosuperiority, this exchanging of an insigniﬁcant Gombrowicz for a signiﬁcant one.Neither the spiritual sense of this passage, nor the sense shamefully personal, northe social sense (the change pertaining to my being grounded in people) wastreated adequately. Convention turned out to be more powerful. Whenever Itouched upon this subject, it always shattered into little pieces, evaporated, turnedinto a joke, polemics, into superﬁcial self-praise, into obstreperousness . . . into afeuilleton. . . . The usual means of articulation got the upper hand. The pas-sages that brush against this string in my diary lack energy, boldness, seriousness,and ingenuity.This is a serious stylistic and personal defeat. And I doubt that even in thefuture I would be able to grab this bull by the horns. The time for that has passed!694Volume 3XVIII

Through me the way to a doleful landThrough me the way to everlasting woeThrough me the way to a forsaken people
‘‘Doleful land? . . . About hell? Couldn’t he have come up with somethingbetter?That’s rather lackluster and ordinary . . . something that is too straight fromlife. . . . I can express it better today! ‘‘Meta!’’ Hell is primarily metaphysical!When speaking of hell, one has to select words that are internally contra-dictory to capture the Inexpressible.So that instead of ‘‘Through me the way to a doleful land,’’ let us writesomething like:
Through me the way to a fathomless landWhich eternally chases its own abyss.
There! That’s better! How much deeper is a hell that plunges into its owndepths. . . .And the second line of this Dantean inscription on the infernal gates(because this is the third canto of the Inferno where Dante and Virgil approach thegates of the Inferno):
Through me the way to everlasting woe
The only disturbing thing here is that ‘‘everlasting.’’ Couldn’t he havebrought himself to ﬁnd something better? I reach for my pen. Let us think amoment. . . . But why wrack my brains? I have at least a dozen better, ready-madeideas nestled in my head . . . such as:
Through me the way to the place whereEternal evil corrodes and consumes itself.
And the following is an interpretation of these lines: whereas in the former(metaphysical) designation, I underscored Hell’s absolute inhumanity, here I ex-1966695press the only thing that could humanize it somewhat and make it accessible toman. To put it simply, it is a botched piece of work. Hell is a bungled enterprise.A modern thought (and what an attractive one to me!).For Absolute Evil must also be ‘‘bad’’ in its being. Evil desiring evil and onlyevil cannot realize itself ‘‘well’’ or fully. An ‘‘evil’’ man does something bad (kills aneighbor), but that evil is a good to him, he does not do it because it is evil butbecause it is good for him and corresponds to his welfare . . . and he does not wantto do this thing ‘‘badly’’ but ‘‘well.’’ This man, like others, therefore, seeks the good;the only difference is that he sees the good in a criminal act. . . . And Satan, Satanwants evil and only evil, he cannot want what is good. Satan, therefore, even wantsto exist ‘‘badly.’’ Hell is something that is poorly realized. It is tainted in its being.Hell is shoddy.An interesting thought. A modern thought. A thought a triﬂe too dialectic,but it does expand the imagination. . . .Nothing else except the idea of a bungled job can make the infernal abyssaccessible to Humanity. A vision of Evil eating its way into itself, tormenting itself. . . yes, that whets the appetite. . . .Our Florentine pilgrim did not know this, he was incapable of such thought.. . . If he had been able to see it, he would have greeted it on his knees, he and Virgil!How his hell would have jumped when gouged with this spur!As for the third line:
Through me the way to a forsaken people
Good, ﬁne. I have no reservations about this line. ‘‘Forsaken,’’ yes, today weknow the taste of that. . . . But I would add just one more slightly unexpectedadjective:
Through me the way to a forsaken andIndefatigable people
Yes, of course, ‘‘indefatigable,’’ that very harsh adjective as in ‘‘indefatigabledancer’’ or ‘‘indefatigable worker,’’ but also close to that other word ‘‘unmurdered.’’. . . Yes, because all of damned humanity is inconsumable, for eternity. Devil andman are the two inexhaustible pillars of hell.Let us read the whole thing from the beginning.696Volume 3Through me the way to a fathomless landWhich eternally chases its own abyss.Through me the way to the place whereEternal Evil corrodes and consumes itselfThrough me the way to a forsaken andIndefatigable people . . .
Now compare this with his superﬁcial and clumsy tercet! What a Danteanhell we would have if it were delineated by my three ideas! But I repeat, I could justas easily have added ten others, equally heady, completely unknown to him (Icould have, for example, conceived of hell as ‘‘continuous,’’ or made it something‘‘granular,’’ or treated it in categories of ‘‘metastasis,’’ ‘‘backdrop,’’ ‘‘transcendence,’’‘‘alienation,’’ ‘‘function,’’ ‘‘mental state,’’ ‘‘being in and for itself,’’ etc., etc., boy, ohboy, oh boy!).When I come in touch with Dante through this swarm, this whirlpool of sixhundred years ﬁlled with existence, I immerse myself in time that has been disposedof to reach him, this dead, this somehow ‘‘former’’ Alighieri. . . . In our communionwith the dead, the only abnormal thing is that we consider it so normal. We say: helived, he died, he wrote the Divine Comedy and now I am reading it. . . .But the past is something that no longer exists. And a past made up of sixhundred years is so distant that I have not even come across it in my own past. Foras long as I have been alive, it has been something ‘‘past.’’ What does it mean,therefore, when we say ‘‘he lived in the past’’? In my present I ﬁnd some sort oftraces—a poem—and from these traces I draw out that bygone existence, I re-createit for myself. But for me to be able to say that someone ‘‘was’’ (an incredible word,something like ‘‘is’’ but weaker), that ‘‘was’’ has to show itself to me on the veryhorizon of my present as the strange point of intersection of two beams of light: onethat issues from me, from my effort to re-create, and the second, which is born onthe outside, at the very intersection of the future and the past, at the very point oftheir passing, allowing one to feel that that which was still ‘‘is,’’ that is, is assomething that ‘‘was.’’Communion with the past is, therefore, a continual laboring to attain it, tosummon it into being . . . but, because we read it from the traces it has left behind1966697and because those traces are themselves dependent on chance, on the more or lessfrail material in which they were left behind, on various experiences in time,because of this, that past is chaotic, accidental, fragmentary. . . . I know nothingabout one of my great-grandmothers, nothing about the way she looked or hercharacter or life, nothing except that on the sixteenth of June in 1669, on the veryday that King Michael was elected, she bought two ells of fustian cloth and ginger.A yellow sheet of paper, covered with ﬁgures, had survived, and in the margin waswritten, I don’t remember it exactly anymore, but something like ‘‘I kindly ask thevillage administrator to buy two ells of fustian cloth and ginger on his way backfrom Remigola.’’ Ginger and fustian, nothing more.The past is a panopticon made of fragments . . . that is really what it is. . . .So isn’t it strange that, in spite of all this, we want it complete, alive, ﬁlled withpeople, a speciﬁc past? . . . and that this is a very stubborn need in us?

It is ten in the morning and fog, pierced here and there by light, is climbingthe mountains.I have noticed for quite a while now that the books I am reading runtogether somehow. For example:
Dante: The Divine ComedyMichel Foucault: The Order of ThingsRoland Barthes: Critical EssaysAnd earlier, a little Borges.
Are these books friendly to me or hostile? Once when sailing down theUpper Paraná on its twisting backwaters, I absorbed the views into myself withtension. The views were new at each bend in the river—as if they could bolster orweaken me, just as during my years of literary work, I cast my eyes over the world tosee whether my Time conﬁrmed or refuted me. For many years, these reconnais-sances were positive, and nothing is capable of cheering you up as much as whenyou see that everything—the evolution of tastes, ideas, customs, techniques—is inalliance with you and opens the door for you. But now the matter has becomemore complicated. Certain phenomena around me are multiplying, things to698Volume 3which I am closely related but which are, at the same time, poisoned by some sortof intention that I ﬁnd intolerable.The problem of Form, man as a producer of form, man as a prisoner ofform, the concept of Interhuman Form as a superior creative force, inauthenticman: I have always written about these things, I was always concerned with them,it was this I drew out, and please replace the word form with structuralism andyou will see me at the center of today’s French intellectual issues. Why, in Ferdy-durke and Cosmos, there is no subject except for the tyranny of form, the balletof structures. And in The Marriage, it is clearly stated: ‘‘We do not say words, theysay us.’’Why, then, is there this antipathy between us . . . as if they were turningaway from me and heading in a different direction . . . their works—whether it istheir nouveau roman français or their sociology, linguistics, or literary criticism—are marked by a spiritual striving that seems quite distasteful to me, unpleasant,inappropriate, impractical, ineffective. . . . But surely the most signiﬁcant thingthat divides us is that they are from science and I from art. They reek of theuniversity. That deliberate and ﬁerce pedantry of theirs. Their professorialness.The spitefulness, obstinance in boredom, unsociability, intellectual pride, aus-terity . . . their manners offend me, their language is too high-ﬂown. . . .But that isnot all. There is also a deeper dimension to the resentment between us. Because Iwant to be relaxation itself and they are cramped, tense, stiff, and pigheaded . . .and while I move ‘‘toward myself,’’ they constantly—and they have been doing thisfor a long time—pant with the desire for self-destruction. They want to get out ofthemselves, leave themselves. The object. Objectivity. Some sort of almost medi-eval asceticism. That ‘‘purity’’ which draws them in the direction of dehumaniza-tion. But this objectivity of theirs is not cool (although it would like to be icy). Thesting of an aggressive intention crouches in it, something provocative, yes, this is aprovocation. And I greet their nomenclature (which I thought had been dead andburied once and for all) with a certain amazement because often it is so close toastrology, the Cabala and magic and so truculent and willful that it is as if deathitself were coming to life.For me, all of man’s strivings to escape himself, whether they are pureaesthetics or pure structuralism, religion, or Marxism, are naive and doomed tofailure. This is a variation on a martyrlike mysticism. And this drive to dehumanize1966699(which I engage in as well) must inevitably accompany the drive to humanize,otherwise reality falls apart like a house of cards and threatens to drown in theverbiage of unreality. No, you will not satisfy man with formulas! Your construc-tions, your structures, will remain empty until Someone comes to live there. Themore elusive man becomes, the more unattainable, abysmal, immersed in theother elements and imprisoned in forms, as if they were not articulated by his ownlips, then the more urgent and burning becomes the presence of the ordinary man,just as we know him in our everyday experience and in our everyday feelings: theman from the café, from the street, given to us concretely. An attainment in thehuman peripheries must immediately be balanced by a violent withdrawal intoordinary humanity and into human everydayness. One can immerse oneself in thehuman abyss, but only under the condition that one returns to the surface.If, however, one would want the deepest and most difﬁcult deﬁnition ofthat someone I am talking about who should begin to live in those structures andconstructions, then I would say that that someone is Pain. For reality is that whichoffers resistance; namely, that which hurts. And a real man is one who is in pain.No matter what we are told, there exists, in the entire expanse of theUniverse, throughout the whole space of Being, one and only one awful, impos-sible, unacceptable element, one and only one thing that is truly and absolutelyagainst us and absolutely devastating: pain. It is on pain and on nothing else thatthe entire dynamic of existence depends. Remove pain and the world becomes amatter of complete indifference. . . .What am I saying! Perhaps this is too serious a subject for mere philosophi-cal discourse. . . . Truly menacing! I would like to note that for those thinkers (andfor others) the world is always, in spite of everything, a place for rather calm, if notOlympian, cerebral speculation. All of these analyses are healthy inasmuch as theyare produced by professors who are pretty well off and rather comfortably seated intheir armchairs. The completely childlike ignorance of pain is at the base of thistireless playing with intellectual blocks. But if Sartre’s freedom feels no pain, and isnot adequately afraid of it, then today’s objectivisms create the impression ofsomething spawned in a state of anaesthesia.Let us underline the contradiction of the above argument. I demand both a‘‘relaxed’’ and ‘‘ordinary’’ man and also a man who is, at the same time, piercedthrough with pain. But the contradiction is superﬁcial.700Volume 3Should I ﬁght with this militant asceticism? Or should I immerse myself inmyself, give myself over to myself, live in myself as in a fortress?I wish them all a toothache.

That book, The Divine Comedy, still in front of me on the table, is really sixhundred years away. What is mankind’s past supposed to mean to me? I am restingon a gigantic heap of corpses: these are the people who have gone before me. Whatis this then that I am resting on? What is this, this pulp beneath me, this anthill ofexistence that ended somewhere beyond me?Am I to look for people in the past or for an abstract dialectic of development?The thing that stands out immediately: only the most important peoplereach me. In History, one must occur to endure. . . . All the cemeteries of ancientGreece boiled down to a few hundred names: Alexander, Solon, Pericles. . . . Andwho, other than Dante, has remained of medieval Florence?In that great procession of all the dead of the world, I would recognizenone except the Great. I like arithmetic, it lets me face certain issues squarely.How many people die daily? Two, three hundred thousand? Every single day, anentire army, approximately twenty divisions, marches into the grave. I am un-familiar with them, I know nothing, I am not au courant . . . nothing . . . nothing . . .all of it happens somewhere beyond me. The discretion of death (and the discre-tion of illness)! Someone who did not know that people die in this world couldspend years roaming our streets, roads, parks, ﬁelds, and squares before he dis-covered that such a thing as death was taking place. And even among animals, this1966701discretion is astonishing. How do the birds, for example, arrange things so that noone knows that they have died? Forests and groves should be littered with deadbirds, yet, instead, you can walk and walk and almost never come across the leastlittle skeleton. What absorbs all this? Where does it go? There are certainly notenough ants or other predators in those forests to do away with all the remains.Death is commonplace, inconspicuous, obscuring.And what of me? Me in these circumstances? I with my necessities, withthe necessities of my ‘‘I’’? The less I can distinguish the cemetery masses, the moreI cling to the Great. I know them personally. They are History. No panopticon ofbits and pieces can take their place.But is my attitude toward them personal enough?I attach enormous weight to this question.The Divine Comedy is not enough. I look for Dante in it. But I willnot ﬁnd him there because the Dante passed down to me by history is noneother than the author of The Divine Comedy. The Great are not people, they areaccomplishments.Yet all the more irritating is the fact that even our attitude toward these ac-complishments has become distorted. At home and in school we are taught nothingbut reverence and respect for these accomplishments, but in real life our attitude isambivalent: it is true that I humble myself and marvel at these works, but I also re-gard them with condescension and disdain. I am lower because they are Great, but Iam higher because I am later, that is, I am on a higher rung of development.This second approach, which I would call a ‘‘brutal’’ or ‘‘direct’’ one, is notused much. We are capable of seeing the artist and his work only from a historicalvantage point and only in the light of their historical signiﬁcance. Let us at-tempt the direct approach. Am I, with my imagination of today, capable of beinggenuinely captivated by the workings of the almost peasantlike, barely stirredimagination of Dante? The sufferings of his damned are so crude! And so meagersomehow! And garrulous! Those discourses expressed between one agony and thenext. . . . The same situations return with a wearying monotony (yet, if I were tojudge the work from a historical perspective, I would have to say that these situa-tions are rich and innovative for a fourteenth-century work), and Temporality, withits political and other troubles, keeps barging into Dante’s Eternity in crudo. Nor702Volume 3does he have a feel for sin: those sins of his have no force of conviction, they aremore like breaking a rule, and, therefore, they neither attract nor repel.How much more one could say to demonstrate that this work is crude,mean, boring, and inferior! And the sad conclusion: that I cannot get to man byway of his work, no matter what I do. For he becomes only a great and historicalaccomplishment. And when I try to get at him brutally, directly, bypassing time,that Divine Comedy of his doesn’t amount to a hill of beans!But does this mean that the past must remain a mere hole? Without realpeople?

I return to the tercet I rewrote earlier:
Through me the way to a doleful landThrough me the way to everlasting woeThrough me the way to a forsaken people
And the next lines of this infernal inscription:
Sacred Justice inspired my CreatorI was made by Divine Omnipotence,By Supreme Wisdom and Supreme Love.
Here suddenly . . . a jolt!What?!How could he?!What monstrousness!How vile!I have just now realized it: this is the most monstrous poem in worldliterature. It is, page after page, a litany of agonies, a register of torments. ‘‘SupremeLove . . .’’ It is exactly these words, ‘‘Supreme Love,’’ that point out the completemonstrousness of this work. And its vileness. I have nothing against Purgatory . . . ifthose sins called for such Satanic punishment then, ﬁne, at least the light ofSalvation gleams in the distance. But Hell?Hell is no mere punishment. Punishment leads to puriﬁcation, it has anend. But Hell is eternal torment and ten million years from now the damned will1966703be wailing just as loudly as they do now, nothing will have changed. One cannotconsent to this. Our sense of justice cannot bear it.Yet he inscribes on the infernal gate. ‘‘I was made by . . . Supreme Love.’’How can one explain this except to say that Dante must have done it out offear and baseness, to ingratiate himself! . . . Terriﬁed and quaking with fright, hepulls himself together and pays the highest tribute to the highest terror and callsthe highest cruelty the highest love. Never has the word love been used in such abrazenly paradoxical way. No other word in the human language has been appliedin such a shamelessly perverse manner. And it is this word that is the most holy, themost sacred. This disgraceful book falls out of our hands, and our wounded lipswhisper: he had no right. . . .I pick the shameful book up again and run my eyes over the poem. Yes,there is no denying it: the entire infernal torture chamber smokes with the incenseof Supreme Love. Dante accepts hell, he agrees to it, ha! he even adores it! Buthow is it . . . how could it have happened that a work so depraved by the wildest fearand so servile, a work so contrary to man’s most fundamental sense of justice, howcould this have transformed itself in the course of centuries into a Book of Ediﬁca-tion, into the most eminent of poems?Catholics . . . this is, after all, your Divine Comedy, how have you been ableto digest it?Man, according to Church doctrine, was created in the image and likenessof God.What is contrary to our deepest sense of justice, therefore, cannot be just.Neither here in this world nor in the next.A Catholic writer cannot write against himself. This entire Divine Comedyis in a state of mortal sin.And the Catholic world adores it nevertheless.

But . . . what is that polyphonic choir, like a choir of frogs, whose voices Ihear rising, like an enveloping fog, like a diluting humidity? . . . The book hasalready become embodied in a concrete man. Yet now, listening more and moreclosely, I realize that it is not he that is singing. It is the entire Middle Ages.How could I have been infuriated moments ago? It is not Dante alone whohas agreed to hell, but his entire epoch. After all, his work is only a recitation offormulas that had already been well codiﬁed in general sentiment. Words, emptywords . . . this is only the way in which people were spoken to at that time. . . .And once again The Divine Comedy becomes a mere monument, form,codiﬁcation, ritual, gesture, rite, ceremony. . . . It is worth noting: when I discovered,a moment ago, that the author was writing against himself, I came into personalcontact with him. But now, now that I have discovered that, in writing againsthimself the author wrote according to the dictates of his Epoch, that inner contra-diction loses its power to bring to life. Everything has paled.Furthermore, how could I have taken the poem’s nobility and its currentprestige seriously a moment ago? Words! Nothing but empty words! . . . This isnothing more than that interhuman ritual of adoration, the equivalent of that otherinterhuman ritual of singing. He ofﬁciates over there, so they bow to him over here.And adoration is the best proof that no one believes a word of what he is saying.Hell! But that’s a myth!Aha, aha, now everything appears in another light. Why was he able to write‘‘Supreme Love’’ so easily? Because that hell is not real. Those torments are rhetori-cal. The damned recite. That eternity is the painless eternity of a ﬁgure of speech.The rising and falling circles, the majestic hierarchies of sins, torments, initiations,prophecies, growing lucidity, virtues and choirs, theology and knowledge, thedamned and holy mysteries: all of it, all of it is rhetoric. Dante was reciting hisepoch, but the epoch was also reciting, and the poem is, so to speak, a doubleplatitude: the poet simply recited what was already being recited. Something likethose Sunday discussions of soccer by people gathered in bars and coffee houses. Dothey really care about soccer? Not in the least. The discussions go on only because1966705those talking are familiar with a certain vocabulary, with a certain way of speakingand because they lack the terminology to talk about something else. Humanityglides along the worn ruts of articulation.An empty poem, which exists in deﬁance of reality and almost as if to spite it!

Wait a minute! This is all falling into place much too neatly.You won’t escape hell this easily, you conniver! It does exist, it does, it does.Have you forgotten that heretics burned at the stake in the name of thecode contained in The Divine Comedy? So that its ﬁre does sear the ﬂesh. . . .And then this infernal poem begins to scream to the high heavens! Andreeks of agony!It is immensely instructive (and I recommend this experiment to all theo-reticians of culture) to get a little closer sometimes to the center of pain. It drawsyou in. After that it is difﬁcult to get out again. And truth becomes a screamand a howl.

But . . .Now it occurs to me again that making something real was possible only inan atmosphere of absolutely reckless unreality.Yes! St. Dominic’s censuring authority had to step down among the poten-tates of the ‘‘lay’’ sword. It had to fall prey to politics, ambition, and various othervery earthly appetites; make its way to bureaucratic tables of ofﬁcials and embodyitself in function, occupation, and work; and, still lower, it had to get itself into thefat paws of thugs insensitive to suffering. Without this gradual degradation, whatman would dare to burn another? These radical ideas of sin, hell, torture, had to bebroken down in many half-ignorant minds and feeble sensibilities before theycould ﬁnally explode with a hard, uncompromising ﬁre that really burned!And what are you, therefore, O Divine Comedy?The ungainly work of a little Dante?Or the mighty work of a great Dante?The monstrous work of an ignoble Dante?Or the rhetorical recitation of a deceitful Dante?706Volume 3The empty ritual of Dante’s epoch?A ﬁrecracker or a real blaze?Unreality?Or a difﬁcult and complex tangle of reality and unreality?Tell me, O pilgrim, how am I to reach you?

I must (because I see that no one will do this for me) ﬁnally formulate themain problem of our times, one that completely dominates the entire Westernepisteme. This is not a problem of History, or a problem of Existence, or a problemof Praxis or Structure or Cogito or Psychology or any other of the problems thathave spread across our ﬁeld of vision. Our main problem is the problem of thesmarter, the dumber.I return to it, although I have brushed up against it on many occasions. . . .The Stupidity that I sense is getting stronger all the time, in a way that is in-creasingly humiliating, that crushes and weakens me; it has gotten stronger since Imoved closer to Paris, the most blunting of cities. I do not assume that I am alonein feeling I am within its reach; it seems to me that all those who participate in thegreat march of modern consciousness have not been able to mufﬂe in themselvesits accompanying step . . . its tearing through the undergrowth right here, righthere. . . . I wondered and I still wonder how to settle on a Law that would most con-cisely describe the speciﬁc situation of the European spirit. I see nothing exceptthe smarter, the dumberActually I am not talking about a certain contingent of stupidity, not yetovercome, that development will come to terms with sooner or later. This wouldbe a matter of stupidity progressing hand in hand with reason, which grows alongwith it. Have a look at all the picnics of the intellect: These conceptions! Thesediscoveries! Perspectives! Subtleties! Publications! Congresses! Discussions! Insti-tutes! Universities! Yet: one senses nothing but stupidity.I must warn you that I am formulating the law the smarter, the dumberwithout a bit of jesting. No, this is really so. . . . And the principle of inverse1966707proportionality seems to get at the very essence of this, for the more noble thequality of reason, the more despicable the category of stupidity; stupidity hasbecome cruder thanks to nothing but its own coarseness, and it eludes the in-creasingly more subtle instrument of intellectual control . . . our reason, too smartto defend itself against stupidity that is too stupid. In the Western episteme what isstupid is stupid in a gigantic way—and that is why it is elusive.I will allow myself by way of an example to indicate the stupidity accom-panying our, ever more rich, system of communication. Everyone will admit thatthis system has been splendidly developed of late. Precision, wealth, the profundityof language in not just brilliant expositions but even in peripheral ones, borderingon publicism (like literary criticism), are worthy of the greatest admiration. But theinundation of wealth brings about a ﬂagging in attention, therefore increasingprecision is accompanied by increasing disorientation. The result: instead of agrowing understanding, you have a growing misunderstanding.And there are even cruder complications marching onto the scene. Be-cause the critic (let us stick with this example) is, it is true, learned, saturated withreadings, oriented, but also overworked, overscheduled, bored, barren; he races toone more premiere, to see one more play, and, after such a onetime look, tohurriedly dash off one more review—which will be thorough and superﬁcial,excellent and slapdash. And, unfortunately, I don’t see that the Western epistemewill be capable of solving the contradictions of the communication system, itcannot even register them, as they are beneath its level. . . . The vulnerability of theepisteme when faced with the most blatant stupidity is a characteristic feature ofour times.An acquaintance of mine told me a story from before the war. They weredrinking a nightcap on the veranda when Uncle Simon showed up. ‘‘What?’’ Iasked. ‘‘Why, Simon has been resting in the cemetery for the past ﬁve years!’’‘‘Well, yes.’’ she replied. ‘‘He came from the cemetery in the suit he was buried in,he greeted us, sat down, drank some tea, chatted a bit about the crops, and re-turned to the cemetery.’’‘‘What?! And what did you do?! . . .’’ ‘‘What did you want us to do, my dear,in the face of such cheek. . . .’’ And this is why the episteme cannot muster a riposte:it is too shamelessly stupid!But—what luxuries!708Volume 3L’écriture n’est jamais qu’un langage, un système formel (quelque vérité quil’anime); à un certain moment (qui est peutêtre celui de nos crises profondes,sans autre rapport avec ce que nous disons que d’en changer le rhythm), celangage peut toujours être parlé par un autre langage; écrire (tout au long dutemps) c’est chercher à découvrir le plus grand langage, celui qui est la forme detous les autres. (Roland Barthes)
Hm . . . what? . . . One has to admit: they do not lack cheek!We so-called artists are mountain climbers from birth; this kind of intellec-tual-verbal hike really agrees with us; if only it did not make us dizzy.

Here I touched upon the stupidities of our system of communication. Letus cast an eye at the garland of stupidity that winds itself around our erudition.It really is a scandal that up until now they did not have a language toexpress their ignorance; they must express their knowledge, their ‘‘mastery of thesubject,’’ constantly and exclusively.When they sit on the dais and participate in discussion, the bolt falls: theymust know it is forbidden not to know, or to know more or less, even with a gesture,even with a wink, they cannot let anyone know that their knowledge is full of holesand hit-and-miss. . . .In the expanse of all discussions consuming the Western episteme, there isnot a single voice that will begin with ‘‘I really don’t know . . . I am not familiarwith . . . I have not read it through very well . . . who could remember all that . . .there is no time to read. . . . I know something on the subject but not too . . .’’ Yetpeople should begin with this! But who would dare! They might begin this way,but all together, having given each other their word of honor ﬁrst!The episteme is falsiﬁed. Ugly things are happening. When not long ago aneminent philosopher visited another eminent philosopher, I said: —Well, will theytalk up a storm about philosophy! —What are you talking about!—answered some-one who was informed.—They wouldn’t be so indiscreet as to check each other’sreadings!The form of transmitting thought has been the same for a long time—it is1966709not subject to evolution—it is always the same string of words running across thepaper. And this verbal tapeworm reaches as far as the sun already! Why don’t theyshout that this activity is exhausting them?
BBB
I would also like to touch upon the obvious stupidity of methods sick withthe same inner contradiction that I have already mentioned. The methods of thehumanistic Western episteme are all the more rigorous the more indeﬁnite itsobject; the more speciﬁc they are, the less their object lends itself to a scientiﬁcapproach.The humanistic faculties of the universities are bursting with heavy, profes-sional nonsense. Delenda est Carthago! Liquidate them!

But what should I do with myself?I am stuck in this!From the time I began to write, I had to keep destroying someone to savemyself. If in Ferdydurke I attacked critics, then it was to exclude myself from this‘‘arrangement,’’ to become independent of it. My attacks on poets, painters, werealso dictated by a need to separate, exclude myself. I died from shame at thethought that I would be an ‘‘artist’’ like they, that I would become a citizen of thatridiculous republic of naive souls, a cog in that awful machinery, a member of thisclan. All for nothing!But as the years passed, my words, these written words, seem to have lessand less to do with me, they are already so far away, in foreign tongues, in variouseditions that I have rarely seen with my own eyes, in the hands of commentatorsabout whom I know nothing. . . . I no longer have any control over this. What thenis happening to me, in what language, in what country? I became a literature andmy rebellions are also literature. And the law the smarter, the dumber can beapplied to me in full.So what next? Close in on an episteme, grab it by the throat, ﬁght with itlike Don Quixote? Again? One thing is certain: my rebellion will ﬁnd publishers,commentators, readers, and will be smoothly absorbed by the mechanism. Why,710Volume 3there is no one in the episteme who is not aware of its irrevelance and whowould, in spite of this, not be a component part. One would somehow have tocunningly . . . perhaps even naively, so simplemindedly that this would becomeirrefutable . . . No. Naïveté with premeditation? No. What sort of force is necessaryto shake this up! I cannot. I cannot afford to. And there is no time. I have to checkon the translations. And there is my correspondence. Other tasks. So what? Noth-ing. Too bad. I can’t do everything myself. Let somebody else. Who? If only I werea leader! To be a leader and to have an army behind you, ready to strike. WhereverI pointed a ﬁnger! All for naught. I am alone. No one will back me up. Can one getoff a train speeding along the tracks? Pound one’s head against a wall? Why? Toﬁnd out that the wall exists. Who does not know this? Everyone knows, everyoneknows everything, but this is private knowledge. . . . Pride. Be happy that at leastyou are defending your dignity. Will I be less ridiculous in a few centuries becauseI wrote what I have here? Good God! This is just an allusion, suggestion, sketch,something like a preface, oh, here in the diary I write at about 10 percent, no more.Sapienti sat. And who, after all, is writing this? . . . Who?Hello, hello! Who is speaking please?I don’t know.

When I readWhen I writeWhen I participateWhen I functionI always and everywhere come upon the lawThe smarterThe dumber.It is very interesting indeed that while our entire spiritual effort in thecourse of centuries goes into separating ourselves from stupidity and triumphingover it, in the very womb of humanity stupidity seems to cohabit with intelligence.The personal makeup of humanity assures stupidity an important role. Humanityis made up of men, women, young people, and children—this alone condemns usto eternal oscillation between development and underdevelopment, stupidity re-vives in each generation. And is it not necessary to life, would a woman want1966711to give birth without it, would orders be possible, obedience, mechanical work,would the railroads, mines, ofﬁces, and factories be able to work without this oil intheir gears? Would death be bearable without lightness, frivolity? The humancondition? The effort of the episteme to cleanse itself of stupidity ﬁnds no conﬁrma-tion in the internal organization of the human species, where it would be moreappropriate to speak of a division of roles: some are supposed to express a superior,others an inferior, consciousness.No, Kant! Your Critique, written with the sweat of your brow, no matterhow precise and profound, is not enough. Grab an ax! Grab an ax, I say, run in withan ax and slash, to the right and left, women and children, young people andworkers, everyone in general, yes, all and everyone! . . . The extermination ofstupidity cannot take place just on paper! Kill! Uh . . . what did I just say?7121967

Rita and I stepped into 1967 yesterday. The two of us, without champagne,looking out our window at the silence, emptiness, our beautiful Place du Grand-Jardin, the steep roofs of old Vence, the cathedral tower, with the stony walls of themountain far away, which the moon ﬂoods with a mystical light.The moon was so strong that one could see a sheet of water beyond Capd’Antibes on the other side.Almost nothing happens to me. The unremarkable state of my health hasbecome something of a cloister for me. I live like a monk. Breakfast at nine, thenwriting, mail at noon, car excursion into the mountains, a stroll, we come back,lunch, newspaper, nap, correspondence, reading. . . . Most often we visit MariaSperling and Józef Jarema, who have a lovely house and an even more beautifulgarden on one of the slopes overlooking Nice.There is no lack of visits because this is the drawing room of Europe,someone is constantly appearing, from America, Australia, Sweden, Poland, thereare scads of kings, ﬁnanciers, maharajas, admirals, movie stars during the holidays.But nothing ever happens. Sometimes, with an effort bordering on self-torment, Itry to unearth in my head some lost detail from years ago. For example, I wonderedabout this yesterday evening and right before falling asleep last night and thismorning: in which courtyard, on what street, did I run for cover from the down-pour then, in September 1955, in Buenos Aires, during the revolution, when I ﬂedfrom my endangered apartment to Russo’s.In spite of everything, there is a lot of bitter irony in this: that now, after an Ar-gentine fast of many years, I have ﬁnally made it to such an elegant country, to such a1967713high civilization, to such landscapes, to such bakery goods, ﬁsh, delicacies, suchroads, beaches, palaces, cascades, and elegant things that, unfortunately, I with mytelevision, record player, frigidaire, and dog, cat, I in the mountains, in the sun, inthe air, at the seaside, that I would have to enter a monastery. But in the depths of mysoul I acknowledge that the Force, which has not allowed me to consume my suc-cess too greedily, is right. I have known for a long time, from the very beginning—Iwas warned in advance—that art cannot, should not, bring personal gain . . . that it isa tragic business. Something else seems unjust to me: that my artistic work has fur-nished me so few of the pure pleasures that are allowed the artist; if writing gives mea certain satisfaction, then it is a cold, stubborn, and even reluctant satisfaction; buthow often do I write like a kid at school doing his homework; and more often in ter-ror; or in nagging uncertainty. It is true that there were times when I was on the vergeof total obsession, I was in no state to tear myself away, for hours after tearing myselffrom the paper I would persist in a strange, barren excitement, repeating sentencesand phrases just written down (I remember one such maniacal stroll in BuenosAires, near the river, when my head was buzzing not even with sentences but withloose words from The Marriage). But this had the character of speeding, some sort ofgallop, trembling, shaking, and did not have much in common with joy.Perhaps this is unjust and a little cruel, that my lofty vocation was accom-panied by such an awful lack of illusions and pitiless sobriety. The anger thatmounts in me when I think about artists like Tuwim, D’Annunzio, or even Gide,would it not be connected to their being able to read someone their text withoutthe desperate suspicion that they were boring him? And I also think that a little ofthat feeling we call the societal meaning of the artist would be more desirable thanmy certainty that socially I am a zero, a marginal being. This is quite sad, however:to devote yourself to art but at the same time to be beyond it, beyond its ceremony,hierarchies, values, charms—with a practically peasant distrust—with a peasant’scunning and reluctant smile.And if one were to accept that at the heart of this matter is an extremelypleasant and salutory thoughtlessness, then why, I ask, have I never known thoseplots and games, those artistic pranks and frolics, that the Skamandrites—or theromantics in Victor Hugo’s day—the surrealists, or other frisky young people knew?My time was bloody and raw, agreed. War, revolution, emigration. But why had Ichosen this time (when I was being born in 1904 in Ma™oszyce)?714Volume 3I am a saint. Yes, I am a saint . . . and an ascetic.In my life there is a contradiction that knocks the plate out of my hands atthe very moment it nears my lips.

Le Clézio? Let it be Le Clézio then, although I have no idea what to writeabout him here. . . . Le Clézio and his wife visited me shortly after I moved toVence and he made the best impression, serious, intelligent, honest. Dramatic (heis twenty-seven) and intense. He is quite handsome and even more photogenic, soL’Express and other revues are plastering whole pages with his photos.The press sees him as the leading presence in French literature à l’heure depromesse, he is already known in Europe, cataloged as the future Camus of France,people stop when he passes them on the street. Twenty-seven years old and he hasthree novels behind him (these Frenchmen . . .).Leaving aside the inconveniences of this somewhat reckless position, LeClézio—or so it seems to me—is endangered from two sides. The ﬁrst danger is hisparadisal-idyllic life. Healthy, strong, tanned among the ﬂowers of Nice, with alovely wife, shrimp, popularity and a beach . . . what more could one want? Hisnovels exhale an impenetrable cloud of the most extreme despair while he, ayoung god in swimming trunks, immerses himself in the salty azure waters of theMediterranean. But this controversy is too superﬁcial to really compromise himand it is only the second venom, much more penetrating, that becomes the vehicleof this ﬁrst poison. This second venom is beauty.I would have had to have known him when he was fourteen, thirteen, to beable to say something more concrete about him. The way I see him now, hedefends himself against beauty with his voice most of all—a voice that is surpris-ingly deep, manly, solid—thus the extreme tragedy of his vision of the world, andalso the heroism of his ethical posture. In spite of this, he makes certain conces-sions. His wife, for example, is also quite lovely and they have an expensive sports1967715car that is no less handsome. And I also consider it very signiﬁcant and characteris-tic that they live in Nice on a square that is called Ile de Beauté (Isle of Beauty). Iwill not claim, of course, that they chose this square on purpose but in life thesekinds of indiscreet coincidences unmasking a hidden tendency do happen . . . thiscoincidence, in my opinion, is not mere coincidence.Le Clézio is thus made up of contrasts: on the one hand, beauty, health,fame, photos, Nice, roses, sports car; on the other, darkness, night, emptiness,loneliness, absurdity, death. But his greatest difﬁculty is that his problems becomelovely in him, attractive. He rebels, ‘‘Youth, I don’t know what that is, it does notexist,’’ he said in an interview . . . but he did not take into consideration that aperson is not young for himself, one is young for others, through others.The only thing that could save him is laughter.

The London Dziennik Polski laments: ‘‘The way in which English criticshandled Pornograﬁa is really very painful.’’ Painful? More like sweet and delightful!For various mongrels in the émigré press under whose skin I got (and justly so becausethey attacked me ﬁrst) can get back at me by saying with a sad face that one review saidPornograﬁa was mad, another that it was stupid, and a third that it was crazy.And in the London Tygodnik Polski we read: ‘‘Derdywurke, that is what acritic for the Times Literary Supplement called his review of Pornograﬁa. Thisjumbled title of Gombrowicz’s ﬁrst novel is supposed to characterize his mostrecent novel: the ﬁrst part of this neologism suggests ‘dirty’; the second ‘work.’ Thewhole means a ‘swinish book’ or something like that.’’Piers Read, the author of this review, writes to me: ‘‘I am at your disposal ifyou would like me to send them a correction. But it’s probably not worth it. It is716Volume 3impossible to understand the title without the rest of the review, where I say thatyou are one of the greatest of European writers. How foul this is! Are you really theobject of such foul play in Polish circles?’’Well, yokels? Piers Read is the son of Sir Herbert Read, the worthy arthistorian, friend of Bertrand Russell and of many other ﬁne men. So naturally inthese circles, as well as in the editorial ofﬁces of the Times, these gentlemen will siptheir whiskeys and say: ‘‘That poor Gombrowicz, how awful that they treat him soshabbily in Polish circles!’’ Oh, yokels! You organize anniversaries, solemnities,spend a ton of money to show off your culture and then some smelly detail like thisslips out and does you more harm than all the good Copernicus, Chopin, andMa™cu˙ zy ´nski can do.It is easy to puff oneself up with Copernicuses. It is more difﬁcult to ﬁnd anintelligent and decent approach to the living values of the nation.Nor does it end here.

Have you received an anonymousletter from London with a clipping from Dziennik Polski yet? —No, but I havegotten an anonymous letter from London with a clipping from Tygodnik Polski! —Terriﬁc! I will send it on to all the newspapers right away! The intellectuals areupset that we are not publishing this Gombrowicz in Poland, that we have for-bidden our press to write about his rotten European awards. . . . Good, orderrescinded, both articles will be scrupulously reprinted, let the people know thatwe are right not to publish such swinish novels like that Pornograﬁa! Comrade!Emigré literature is rotten to the core but the émigré press has some very healthyreﬂexes! (Both do a little dance waving their clippings. Music. Ballet. Confetti.)So now what, defenders of Polish culture? And as for the swinishness itself,well, I once knew a Pole who was lost deep in thought. After which he shook it offand said: ‘‘It takes a pig to screw a pig.’’ ‘‘Who do you have in mind?’’ I asked. ‘‘I amthinking of Poles.’’

I bought a period wardrobe as well as a period table and High Renaissancechairs.Let us jot down what happened with the Prix International de Littérature,twenty thousand dollars.I have been nominated for this award for the last ﬁve years. While its ﬁrst laure-ates, Beckett and Borges, both excellent, seemed to deserve it 100 percent, the nameshonored in the years that followed smelled of calculations that did not have much todo with pure art. My candidacy slowly began to take on some vibrancy and two yeasago I almost snagged the award for Pornograﬁa. But luckily the venerable Mrs.McCarthy voted against me. What luck! How much I owe this ﬁne writer! Through718Volume 3the intercession of the Most High (who probably wanted to reward me for the conspir-acy that victimized me), the award was afterward reformed to lend it greater weightand to provide it with double the number of dollars. From then on, it was going to beawarded only once every two years and the ten thousand jumped up to twenty.I was possessed by mad desire when I read of this change in Le Monde.But aware of the fact that I am a perfectly private, ideally isolated individ-ual, deprived of cliques, coteries, groups, embassies, uninteresting from a politicalor economic vantage point, I told myself, using the words of the czar of all theRussians: point de rêveries!In the meantime, bam! Bonanza! Twenty thou. A sum like this doesn’tgrow on trees, so, ha, has, I will buy myself a nice little car!Immediately upon receiving the award I made myself a list of all my literaryenemies (the majority, unfortunately, were Polish names) and picking out this orthat name at random, I drank deeply in my imagination of that desperate acid, thatsort of gray bitterness.This was my only pleasure. Outside of this there was more work thananything else; I had to do about thirty interviews alone. As for my fame, it turnedout to be quite speciﬁc. The French critic Michel Mohrt said, among other things,in defending my candidacy during the jury’s deliberations: ‘‘There is some sort ofsecret in the work of this writer, I would like to get to know him, who knows, maybehe is a homosexual, maybe an impotent, maybe an onanist, at any rate he hassomething of the bastard about him and I would not be surprised to ﬁnd out that hegave himself up quietly to orgies like King Ubu.’’ This acute interpretation of myperson and works in the best French taste was broadcast by the radio and multi-lingual press, and as a result, the young people sitting in the café on the square inVence observe when they see me go by: —Look, there’s that old impotent homo-sexual, who is a bastard and has orgies!’’ And because the Scandinavian delegationon that jury supported me as a ‘‘humanist,’’ some of the press reports bore therhyming title ‘‘Humanist or Onanist.’’In another report on the proceedings I read that an American critic, anadvocate of Mishima’s, my Japanese rival, let slip that he had not read my Cosmos at all. When he was asked how he could know that Cosmos was a worse novel thanMishima’s, he answered that he was sorry but he couldn’t read Cosmos because hehadn’t gotten it in time.1967719I am also noting that the jury forgot to inform me about getting the award.After waiting for eight days and getting no ofﬁcial telegram, I wrote to Nadeau toask him what this meant. It turned out that the Secretary General had lost myaddress somewhere and then told himself that it wasn’t worth letting me knowbecause I had probably already found out from the press.But these are triﬂes. I am accustomed to this, all that counts is that I havethe award in my pocket and that I won the race, I must say, under tight rein,because, to everyone’s stupefaction, in the preliminary ballot, of thirty candidates,only Mishima and I remained in place, everyone else dropped out. I therefore haveconﬁrmation in writing that I am a writer in high regard and this certiﬁcate issigned by the cream of international criticism. Triumph! Success! Bravo! Whythen, O laureate, is your face stiffening, becoming harsh—revolting—where hasthe starkness, exoticism, loneliness, dumb gravity, profound antipathy, and painfulirony come from, as if the face were being closed by seven seals? . . . An alien faceexpressing just one thing: let them dance around you as much as they want, don’tyou bat an eyelash!Mieroszewski expresses surprise in Kultura that the Poles in emigration arenot happy enough about my success. I am amazed that he is amazed. For them anaward like this is at most testimonium paupertatis, proof that they cannot ﬁgure outtheir own values. What is there to be happy about? If one of ‘‘ours’’ had snagged thislittle prize, Wierzy ´ nski, for example, there would be a jubilee! But with me, thisway or that, nothing but unpleasantries.Let them dance around you as much as they like, but you don’t move amuscle! That my things have not lost their vitality in thirty years, that this Ferdy- durke of mine can be greeted with an explosion of joy today by an Italian, Dane,Canadian, Paraguayan, just as it was years ago—this means something to me!

I recall that in writing about Tyrmand’s Angry years ago I began like this:‘‘Tyrmand! Talent!’’ And today I prize this poem in a hooligan’s cap, stinking ofvodka and defeat, with a romantic moon over the caverns of a strangely protrudingWarsaw. Easy? ‘‘Criminal’’? Popular? Almost of the streets? But yes! And becausethis singing from a fermenting mug, gap-toothed from a ﬁght, does not care who’slooking, does not want to be a higher literature, nor a folk or proletarian literature,but is simply born of a trivial, street taste, of genius loci, of the imagination, like acat padding along these hovels, that is why, I say, this is a work worthy of admirationand creative in its own way. And lively.It is likely, then, that Jele ´ nski and others exaggerate in taking up the samecondescending attitude toward this gap-toothed poet that he has already beenoffered in Poland. That Tyrmand, having gotten out into freedom, now takes careof personal accounts at ﬁrst opportunity? Even if this were so, isn’t every trialagainst the current Polish system also, if not primarily, a personal battle? In addi-tion, Tyrmand’s feature, like all of their features, formed by postwar Poland, is lackof crystallization, they are like a shaken liquid that has not been able to settle inlayers, their best values are somewhat defenseless, because they are too messy withlife. Perhaps this is not so bad at times when we have learned all too well how to1968727isolate values and use them. H™asko, Tyrmand, belong to that faction of our mod-ern literature that is perhaps the most original and fraught with the greatest per-sonal difﬁculties. I would allow Tyrmand to do battle, however, with whatever hewants, and I would follow him to see what appears in the sparks of this fray—because his Social and Emotional Life, although it is something of a satire and theanalysis of a gap-toothed lyrical tenor, does lead to reality . . . to a certain peculiar,Polish reality . . . and becomes unusual, exceptional, characteristic. Why? Whybecause one reads the book and its author at the same time, the author is ‘‘fromover there,’’ is created by what he describes, is tied to his description with aninvisible umbilical cord, is always the son of what he is denying—even though hehas broken away, even though he ﬁghts it. This stamps the book with a particularauthenticity. It is best seen in the most innocent marginal little sentences, thosethat are least engaged politically, involuntary.

Astonishing and embarrassing. Lechon’s Diary, Volume I, which I lookedthrough once again, a little more carefully. How did this tangle that makes up thetrue originality of this diary come to be? That combination of artistry, tremendoussensitivity and acuity with . . . primitiveness, ignorance, narrowness, blindness? Ingeneral, the language is wonderful and in this language are expressed subtlejudgments about literature, art, and, frequently, people, but it is also in this lan-guage that Lechon expresses his awful, unbearably Polish limitations. From anintellectual standpoint, the diary is like a 1939 suit we remove from our wardrobe—it reeks of mothballs. Lechon had no access to modern man or the modern world;he was lost in culture, didn’t have a clue about contemporary thought, aboutanything that would allow him to grasp and order the present-day world. Chaos.Darkness. Fog and confusion. Superﬁcial passions and complexes. The years hespent in Paris ran off him like rain from a roof. And when History kicked him out ofPoland for good, he drowned in the big wide world like a squire dispossessed of hisholdings.The tragic tone of the notes revealing Lechon’s struggles with the novelBall at the Senator’s is comical. Nothing beyond naïve ‘‘questions’’ like, shouldSkarga appear before or after the dialogue with Eleanor.How did this fetid basement establish itself in our spirit? Could blindnessto the world, naïvete, ignorance, have been caused by loss of independence? YetSaxon Poland was clearly the stupidest country in Europe, and even in the Jagiello-nian period brought up the rear of civilized countries; while France boasted Rabe-lais and Montaigne, we had Rej and Kochanowski. So what is it? What’s the1969729reason? The lack of larger cities? Polish ‘‘provinciality’’? The undisputed spiritualprimacy of the parish priest? Yes, but perhaps these are not the most important;more important may be the form, that vulgarization of the form of Europe whichﬁnely sculpted, like Greece, rolls across the Polish plains into the coarse immen-sities of Russia, Asia. Being a transitional country is not easy!Because pompous titles tend to proliferate in a backwater, Lechon became‘‘Poet Altissimo’’ and Jozef Mackiewicz the ‘‘Commander-in-Chief.’’ But if Altis-simo was at least a pedigreed artist, the Commander-in-Chief would have beenbetter off as a captain of the, I want to say ‘‘light’’ but I’ll say heavy, cavalry. TheCommander-in-Chief lives for one idea—his battle with communism—and noth-ing else concerns him, especially not the thought that these ﬁfty years of bloodyrevolt are the answer to a thousand years of oppression of peasants and workers bythe petty gentry which sat astride the boors and stuffed themselves. The battle withcommunism and also the examination of the snobberies, eccentricities, and ex-cesses of today’s intellectualism appear to be indispensable and I cultivate themmyself. But bravado of 1939 vintage, when Polish lancers charged tanks to theastonishment of the entire world—and nothing more, is not enough. I will allowmyself the assumption that if the higher literary and intellectual strata of Europewere not equally well armored against his charges, like those tanks, his judgmentsabout them would not be so harsh. Tough and too bad—names like Schulz, Witkie-wicz, Milosz, or Mro˙ zek have reached these strata, but not a word about the Com-mander-in-Chief. He claims that my Ferdydurke is ‘‘inﬂated’’ but facts are facts andFerdydurke, though written 30 years ago, has conquered, with youthful verve, prac-tically all the countries of the West; if they translate the Commander-in-Chief nowand then, it is not because he is good but because he is easy. It’s true that it isdifﬁcult to establish a hierarchy for artistic works but, if I am a writer and I livetwenty kilometers from the Nice airport and deal incessantly with writers, critics,journalists of all nations, and I do not hear the name ‘‘Mackiewicz,’’ I have the rightto say that his books excite no interest in the reader who takes literature seriously.Nonetheless, the Commander-in-Chief looks down his nose at me and scolds mefor being a snob, poseur, dimwit—eternally the same hopeless litany of names, asstupid as they are offensive, showered upon me from time immemorial by themental impotence of a certain sector of the emigration. When I was eight years old,I applied a certain ‘‘Peek-a-boo’’ tactic in ﬁghts with my older brother. I would crawl730Volume 3out from behind a bush and yell: ‘‘Lunatic!’’ And when he bolted in my direction, Ipopped out from behind another bush and yelled, ‘‘Oaf!’’ Aren’t these rather child-ish methods, gentlemen, considering we are all, more or less, in our sixties? TheCommander-in-Chief’s crude attacks make it easy for me because they free mefrom having to exercise the restraint to which I have always felt bound in rela-tion to émigré writers. But it is time to put the brakes on our increasingly froth-ing Savonarola. Attention, Your Lordships! Under the leadership of this kind ofCommander-in-Chief, you’ll go straight to Backwardville.P.S. In his article in Wiadomo´ sci about a collection of Hemar’s columns,on whom he showers the highest praise (‘‘the most intelligent book to have ap-peared in emigration’’), the Commander-in-Chief makes the disclaimer that hispraise is not in the least connected to the exaggerated enthusiasm expressed byHemar in his article. It appears that in the last issue of Wiadomo´ sci we read Hemar’s letter to the editors. ‘‘Please congratulate that terriﬁc Mackiewicz . . . whata ﬁne lesson in writing essays!’’But this was not about Mackiewicz’s essay on Hemar, but about the nextone, devoted to a book by General Prag™owski, which the Commander-in-Chiefpronounces ‘‘splendid’’ or something like that. Congratulations. Not three monthshave passed and we have four masterpieces! Living is easy in a mutual adorationsociety!

My polemic with Barbara Szubska in Wiadomo´ sci —joined by about ﬁfteen people—scandalized a few of my friends who write to me: who ever heard of aserious writer slumming this way! Jele ´ nski says that they persist in convention andhave no understanding of the point. He’s right. To climb off the pedestal, dismissthe courtiers and personal guard, undress completely, hang the ermine boas on apeg, and go out and brawl with the ﬁrst guy who comes along—yes, this is my style.In this kind of ﬁghting, all the artiﬁcial ‘‘superiority’’ of the writer—based onconvention and ceremony—vanishes, and instead the actual superiority assertsitself with even more ruthlessness and annoys real inferiority, that awful, hauntingproblem. Why, I have maintained for a long time that the judgment of an inferior1969731touches and hurts, like ‘‘a shoe that is too small,’’ and that it is not true that ‘‘writers’’don’t care.And it is better that this ﬁstﬁght in the nude was started by a woman. Awriter and a woman are two delicate and protected beings, so it’s great that we had aﬁght. Surely it would have been even more interesting if I had taken the ﬁghtseriously; nevertheless, the fact that I challenged Basia publicly to recognize herown inferiority and my superiority, has signiﬁcance. This polemic—I will allowmyself to modestly observe—is the only one like it in the history of literature. Gloryto Basia and me!It is easy to understand where the difﬁculty and danger of the issue lie.Basia, like, o horror, everyone else, can see the world only with her eyes and thriveonly in her own mind. Even if she says, ‘‘He who is superior is better than me,’’ it isshe, not anyone else, who has made the judgment. And even if she said shebelieved in the superiority of Einstein, because she was so informed by those whounderstand, she, not anyone else, has to decide ultimately whether or not thosespecialists are worth trusting. Therefore, because each person, like it or not, has tobe the center of his world and the highest judge, this argues against objectivitywhich tells us to recognize the worlds and views of others. The torment of thosewho came to Basia’s aid and threw me into confusion comes from this because,objectively speaking, it is difﬁcult to assume that all who praise me are cretins; andagain one cannot see with someone else’s eyes and from this perspective, all thosewho praise me are cretins and me, too. Contradiction. Inde irae.Sure, if I could take all of this seriously . . . yet, in spite of everything, it wasan instructive experience. The most important thing is that after this run-in, I feltmuch more comfortable with Basia, a lot better, practically chummy. But whatabout her? If she feels this way, too, then this would prove that it is easier to bear thesuperiority-inferiority torment if one is naked than if one is swaddled in subtleties,manners, pruderies, other hypocrisies.

The most profound division in a man, his bleeding wound, is precisely this:subjectivism—objectivism. Basic. Hopeless. The relation of subject-object that is732Volume 3consciousness and the object of consciousness is the starting point of philosophicalthought. Let us imagine the world reduced to just one object. If there were no onethen to register the existence of that object, it would not exist. Consciousness isbeyond everything, is deﬁnitive. I am aware of my thoughts, my body, my impres-sions, my sensations, and that is why all this exists.Even in ancient times, in Plato and Aristotle, thought splits into subjectiveand objective. Aristotle, by way of Thomas Aquinas, reaches us by various routes,and Plato by way of St. Augustine, by way of Descartes, by way of the blindingexplosion of Kantian criticism, and from it the line of German idealism throughFichte, Schelling, Hegel, and by way of Husserl’s phenomenology and existential-ism comes into a ﬂowering, greater than in the early days. Objective thoughtmanifests itself today primarily in Catholicism and Marxism; but Marxism is not,as Marx himself claimed, a philosophy and Catholicism is metaphysics, based onfaith, quite the paradoxically subjective conviction that the objective world exists.Do you want to rediscover subjectivity and objectivity in the plastic arts?Have a look. Are not the Renaissance and the Baroque, objectivity and subjectivity,respectively? In music Beethoven is subjective, Bach objective. And what mindshave spoken on behalf of subjectivity! Artists, thinkers like Montaigne or Nietzsche. . . if you want to see how profusely this duality is still bleeding, read the dramaticpages in Sartre’s Being and Nothingness, devoted to the strange question, do peopleother than me exist?I say ‘‘strange problem’’ because the existence of other people is surely themost visible, tangible reality—but for Sartre the existentialist, Marxist, and moral-ist, it appears to be almost a matter of life and death to recognize that reality. Yetafter a thorough analysis of this problem in Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and Husserl,Sartre is forced to accept that the existence of another human being is unaccept-able to a strictly scientiﬁc, philosophical mind. Why? Because I am, in my veryessence, pure consciousness. I am a subject. . . . And if I were to accept that anotherhuman being is also consciousness, then I become, in that very instant, the objectof another’s consciousness, and, therefore, a thing. Two subjects cannot exist inrigorous thinking; one excludes the other.To the ignoramuses for whom philosophy is a heap of nonsense becausethey understand nothing of it, I will allow myself to observe that others puzzle overanalogous paradoxes, for example, physics scholars (wave and corpuscular theory,1969733the dual concept of electrons, the Einstein continuum, and Planck’s theory).Everywhere, everywhere, the deepest human thought shatters against the sameduality of interpretation, irreconcilable internally. And this is why people aremysteries to themselves.But for Polish thinkers this trivial little problem is pure bother, suitableonly for egocentrics, snobs, or aesthetes.And it is a peculiar thing, but this contradiction appears again when we tryto think about what consciousness is as such, as pure consciousness—because thepoint is that consciousness must be consciousness of something, is correlative; Ican be aware of the shape of this table, or the movements of that cow, but con-sciousness in isolation from its object cannot be thought as it is the act of becomingconscious of something. Thus here the right of equivalence, that A is equal to A, isdeceptive—again the basic contradiction in our thinking, impossible to overcome,and this leads us to an existentialist formula, which throws into relief the somehowfundamental ‘‘veering away occurring in us, this elusiveness of humanity: man isthat which he is not and is not that which he is.’’This, in rough outline, is how the little problem of subjectivity looks, tomany minds nothing but ‘‘an egotistical gazing at one’s own bellybutton’’ and‘‘muddleheadedness.’’To dull-witted minds everything is murky. The trivial problem, that littledifﬁculty, dominates all of contemporary culture. But muddled heads are not evencapable of understanding their own struggle with subjectivity and objectivity. ForMarxism derives from science, is a scientiﬁc experiment, that is, an objectiveorganization of society, and is thereby an abstract theory operating with abstractconcepts, conceiving of people, so to speak, ‘‘from the outside.’’ And he whodefends his inner world, his freedom, his private, concrete life, is on the side ofsubjectivity.Here is one more example illustrating the difference between objectivityand subjectivity. When you are operating on a man who has had an appendixattack, he is an object for you, you operate on him exactly the way you would ﬁx acar or any other machine; this is a mechanism functioning poorly. But from theperspective of the sick man, the one who is ‘‘experiencing’’ the operation, thematter presents itself differently; it is something separate, unique, his own; this is‘‘his’’ operation.734Volume 3Monday

Heart attack and marriage. Today I am walking around the apartment abit—after four months—and I am beginning to write a little. Everything happenedin the past as if in the past perfect—on November 17 in early morning—ﬁerce painsin the area of the heart—I can’t move, I moan. But a man is an endless surpriseeven to himself, and I, even though I was afraid I was dying, and had a sharp painboring into my chest, I was too embarrassed to waken Rita and to call a doctor atsuch an early hour; ﬁnally he came and gave me a shot, but when the pain calmed,Rita and I were overcome with gaiety and good humor, we laughed and said sillythings; the doctor looked at us as if we were a couple of dimwits.In the following days a few more attacks—I lay condemned to absolutemotionlessness—incoherent from pills. If I moved my hand, the doctor yelled,‘‘Don’t move!’’ The immobility lasted two months—it is better now, but I was notallowed to leave the house for four months but was able to answer the most urgentletters, to listen to music. A heart attack is what this is called.I did not die yet something in me was touched by death—[some sort of shiftin time had taken place]—the time before the illness is as if behind a wall. Somesort of new difﬁculty between me and the past.[Dr. Marinov said, ‘‘You had very little chance of making it.’’ I understoodthis as the attacks were coming one right after another, but I was not—o wonder!—too concerned with dying; I simply kept hurrying Rita to give me the painkiller.Rita defended me valiantly as much as she could and struggled with trem-bling hands not to lose a single drop of the injection.We were married about a month later, in late December. I wavered—she1969735was over thirty years younger than I—and I am nearing the end, [but she had takensuch a beating, had lost so much weight during those sleepless nights and difﬁcultdays that] I ﬁnally made up my mind. [She is young, pretty, lively, intelligent, andwithout a shadow of artiﬁce, straightforward, frank.]*On January 7,† I married Rita, who has been my faithful companion forthe last ﬁve years, and in the end, in my illness, dazzled me with her faithfulnessand devotion. Me, 64, with her, so young? Does this make any sense? Yet when aperson has one foot in the grave, sense is blurred. And she accepted this with joy; ithad never even occurred to me that this was what she wanted, what she wants. ACanadian, pretty, unusually sincere, a little naïve in her sincerity and innocence,intelligent (we spend hours discussing things and do not grow bored with oneanother), independent, slightly boyish, she wins people over; not an iota of preten-tiousness, artiﬁciality, putting on airs—in short, good manners.The marriage was very private, in our home, in the presence of only thePaczowskis who, at word of my illness, rushed here from Milan to nurse me. Twoor three days later we read in Nice Matin that the venerable writer Count Gombro-wicz married his secretary on his deathbed (not on my deathbed as much as in awheelchair). It appears that the description of this dramatic ceremony was dis-tributed to newspapers. It appeared in Europe and America. I’m afraid that nowthere is no human power capable of persuading both hemispheres that I am not acount. I am also afraid that this will be considered snobbery on my part when, infact, it is rather an expression of my not taking titles too seriously. I once pro-nounced myself a count in Argentina to irritate the authentic ones, as well asserious democrats and socialists responsible for the word, and also to introduce alittle luster [luxury] into my Argentine squalor. Today there is nothing I can do. Iam a count. And all the vendors address Rita as ‘‘Madame la Comtesse.’’In light of the fact that the ﬁrst and second ﬂoors of our little house havebecome inaccessible to me—no elevator—I have rented a modest apartment onthe third ﬂoor of the Val-Clair residence on the southern slope of Vence, on theroad to St. Paul. No more than six rooms, but it has the advantage—because ofoccupying the entire top ﬂoor, of being surrounded by an enormous veranda,

One observes the same old internal quadrille among Poles visiting fromPoland. They say communism is suffocating us, impeding development, the coun-try is impoverished, we have no freedom of speech. . . . And immediately afterward,what do they say? Our literature, the rebuilding of Warsaw, our bicycles andmotorcycles, our postage stamps are among the most beautiful, and our ballet . . . for we are—tah-dah! The prancing Cracovians!Either or. Either literature is stiﬂed or it is ‘‘great.’’ What shame doesn’tallow us to admit to being ourselves, that mania of adhering to fashion! Putting on agood face.A Pole who can own up to himself immediately becomes a European and ahigh-class European. The Pole who hides things, tries to put on airs abroad, who isashamed as if today’s or yesterday’s stagnation was solely his fault, identiﬁes with hismisery. Whosoever tosses off his old rags becomes supremely naked; whosoever isroyally ashamed of the frayed pant cuffs he hides under a chair and the holes in hisjacket he covers with his hand is a beggar. That eternal shame of ours! Thatweakness!Mr. Stanislaw Kocik writes occasionally in a certain Parisian daily informa-tional articles about literary life in Poland. Not long ago he wrote a little article inwhich he calls me ‘‘the most Polish of the ‘great’ contemporary Polish writers.’’Very nice but wouldn’t it have been better to have said, ‘‘distinguished’’? Who willbelieve that in Poland currently we have so many ‘‘great’’ writers if no one in theWest knows anything about them? Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz is, according to1969737our Mr. Kocik, ‘‘immense,’’ and I have nothing against his opinion, but wouldn’t itbe better to have a sense of humor and not toss around so much immensity and‘‘greatness? I am proud that Mr. Kocik took advantage of the opportunity to writeabout me and smuggle in so much ‘‘Polish greatness’’ but this could backﬁre since,irritated by such a number of greatnesses, I am ready to mention something hereand there in the foreign press about mediocrity. It’s odd. My entire life I havefought not to be a ‘‘Polish writer’’ but myself, Gombrowicz; that whole habit ofcalling a writer ‘‘our’’ I consider ridiculous. ‘‘Stayed the sun, moved the earth, bornof the Polish nation’’ smells a little musty in the Europe creating itself now. I foughtto be myself and lo and behold the nation, as personiﬁed by Mr. Kocik, plucks meout and makes me a feather in his peacock tail. It is also irritating that Mr. Kocik,having mentioned that I am a banned writer in Poland, did not hesitate to add thatnonetheless I ﬁgure in some encyclopedia there, that some weekly there hasnonetheless printed, in the last decade, an essay about me written by a certainYugoslav, and that somehow my play, The Marriage, was performed in the prov-inces (this lasted three days before the police banned it). What sort of lofty impar-tiality is this? Wouldn’t this serve to demonstrate that things are not so bad after all,that culture does indeed exist in Poland, etc.? Good God! Do I need to explainfurther that such silly pastiches applied to the serious issue of censorship couldonly arouse pity in a French reader? It would be better, Mr. Kocik, if you didn’twave Witkiewicz like a ﬂag and simply spoke candidly. Even Poland would beneﬁt.There is another, even more subtle, example, but this one doesn’t lenditself to jokes. After the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Soviet armies, Polish pro-tests—some of them, like Andrzejewski’s, rather courageous—appeared in the émi-gré press. Being of the opinion that a writer is not leader or teacher but a privateindividual and perhaps even more private than others, I sign no protests on prin-ciple. The protests have multiplied beyond efﬁcacy. Nonetheless, I share com-pletely their feelings and I respect them unstintingly. But a certain detail, almostFreudian, intrigues me: their practically child-like outrage appears to forget thatPoland has suffered the same assault. For years Poland has been an occupiedcountry—exactly like today’s Czechoslovakia. If they had said, ‘‘For me violence isa daily act, I know what it is, therefore I condemn the Russian invasion,’’ everythingwould be clear. But they have forgotten . . . even those who live abroad. Engrossedin Czechoslovakia, they have forgotten their own fate.This page intentionally left blank 739TRANSLATOR’S AFTERWORD
As I look upon three very worn, broken-spined volumes of Witold Gombrowicz’sDiary in my favorite, Instytut Literacki, edition, I realize that what I will miss mostabout translating these books are the accompanying dreams. Diary works its myste-ries on the reader’s innermost life, and whenever I translated Gombrowicz, hiswritings inspired wonderfully extravagant dreams: I am aboard a ship that is mov-ing at dizzying speed—I see the curve and foam of its wake as it turns, leaps, andsomersaults over the water and into the air; the only steady point of orientation inall the thrilling movement is someone’s left shoe on deck. In another dream I amthere, in Santiago del Estero, and my voluminous skirts rustle and sway as I walkexamining the town, or a relaxed Gombrowicz strolls among old oaks and mani-cured lawns in a blinding white suit, bucks, panama hat, talking to Berkeleyprofessors and dazzling them with his ﬂawless English. In the last dream, I am inmy own garden and every plant that has ever grown there and died is suddenlyblooming, bearing ﬂower after ﬂower, and I am overwhelmed by the bounty andespecially by the miracle of a pink and white magnolia in a corner I had nevernoticed before. When I call others to show them, the blossoms are too high forthem to see, just at the tip of a tree that is now a very tall and somber pine.In the course of translating Diary I have watched many reviewers breaktheir pens (just as I have broken all of my translator’s teeth) trying to get Gombro-wicz right. He has been called a ‘‘crank,’’ ‘‘enfant terrible,’’ ‘‘scourge,’’ ‘‘prophet,’’‘‘bad boy,’’ ‘‘hermit,’’ ‘‘demythologizer,’’ ‘‘cunning child,’’ ‘‘the anti-intellectuals’intellectual,’’ and ‘‘classy heel,’’ just to begin the list. My own favorite image ofGombrowicz is that of a Socratic or Voltairean gadﬂy, egging on the lagging oldmare of Polish culture or sinking its teeth into the backside of complacent intellec-740Translator’s Afterwordtuals, modern-day ‘‘scorpion people whose knowledge is awesome but whose gazeis death.’’ And many critics (including one Oxford notable) who tried to maketoo much sense of the mundane-metaphysical cocktail of Gombrowicz’s musingsended up, as Gombrowicz had predicted, with an oral cavity full of his dead body.Gombrowicz wrote that during the interwar period in Poland it was easiestto write a novel and most difﬁcult to have an honest conversation. Diary is reallythis overdue conversation with the reader, whom Gombrowicz, for all his sillinessand provocation, is treating with utmost seriousness. And while one can spend agreat deal of time analyzing his critique of Marxist literary theory or existentialismor interwar Polish literature, the real beneﬁts of this literary partnership are oftensecret, subterranean, elusive, subversive, difﬁcult to put into words and label resis-tant because they do not translate into knowledge as such but simply into a richcompost for our imaginative ﬂowerbeds. I urge the reader to judge Diary accordingto the basic criteria for judging art that Gombrowicz himself reintroduced: Does itstrengthen or debilitate? Does it make you regard your identity as a more expan-sive, spacious, freer place—failures, complexes, ignorance notwithstanding—ordoes it paralyze, gag, diminish?In the third volume of Diary there is one passage that is quintessentialGombrowicz. Having received a Ford stipend, he is living in West Berlin and isinvited to a reading and discussion of his own work in German, a language he knewonly superﬁcially. He is listening to his work being read and discussed in a languagenot his own, and he feels himself fading, disappearing. To assert his existence assomething more than just an appendage to his work, to assert his being in thatroom, he begins to babble his imperfect German, to argue passionately in gibber-ish, to gesticulate violently—anything at all to make his existence known. And it isthis insistence on making sure others know you are alive—in spite of the nonsensi-cal means sometimes necessary to preserve that dignity—that governs this work.A translation is never the work of just one person, and there are two peoplewho were indispensable throughout the years of work on Diary. The ﬁrst is Jar-os™aw Anders, who reviewed the manuscripts and frequently saved me from pits ofabysmal ignorance; the second is Susan Harris, managing editor at NorthwesternUniversity Press, who sublime patience, unfailing courtesy, and wicked humormade a daunting task doable (and probably gave her an ulcer). While the transla-tion is not perfect, I think Gombrowicz would have been tickled by the fact thatTranslator’s Afterword741Diary, the masterwork of a cosmopolitan from the provincial Polish village ofMa™oszyce, appeared in English through the labors of a provincial from the greatindustrial city of Detroit.This is not a book for the pusillanimous or the pedantic. But if you wantwild, extravagant dreams, if you want to reclaim every dead plant and neglectedcorner of your imaginative garden plot, take Diary, read it twice, dance with it inthe rain, pass it on to a loony friend. Let Gombrowicz rise from your garden, darkas a soaring pine, translucent as a magnolia blossom.This page intentionally left blank 743CHRONOLOGY OF IMPORTANT DATES
